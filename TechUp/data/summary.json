That’s one way to look at Tuesday’s announcement from the company formerly known as Facebook: Meta is revamping its flagship app with a number of features focused on connecting friends, along with design changes, including a renewed focus on what still works, like its popular Facebook Marketplace.The changes come days after news of Meta considering sizable cuts to its metaverse efforts, which, before the AI boom, aimed to make virtual worlds and VR the company’s next big bet in social networking. Meanwhile, Facebook still reaches billions, even if its growth remains flat in key markets like the U.S.As Facebook’s population ages, the app remains in heavy use among boomers and Gen Xers. That’s led Meta to try to find a footing among a younger demographic. After failed attempts to reboot Facebook as a home for college kids, the company has been making more noise recently around giving Facebook a Gen Z makeover.But what’s been resonating with younger people is Facebook Marketplace.The company’s online marketplace is used by more than half of its Gen Z users in the U.S., according to a 2025 eMarketer report on social media users. Last month, Meta confirmed the trend, noting that Marketplace was used by one out of four young adult daily active Facebook users in the U.S. and Canada.Despite the traction, however, Marketplace has remained buried in the “More” menu under users’ profiles in the Facebook app.This new update, rolling out soon, will add Marketplace to the app’s bottom navigation bar, alongside other social and creator-focused features like Reels and Friends.Reels and direct messaging have been the most popular features on Instagram, the company said earlier this year, which is why it began testing a redesign that centered those in the mobile experience. Now Facebook is getting similar treatment in terms of recentering friends as part of the experience.The Profile tab will remain in the navigation bar, and users will be able to customize the experience.Another part of the makeover will allow users to double-tap photos in their Feed to like them, similar to Instagram. These photos will be arranged in a standardized grid, and users will be able to see photos full-screen by clicking them.Search is changing to include a more imm"

        "fullContent": "eNewspaperSign up for email newslettersSign up for email newsletterseNewspaper\n\t\t\tTrending:\t\tParamount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros. Discovery places CNN and its sister cable networks squarely back into what is likely to be an extended period of management limbo.There was some relief at CNN with last Friday’s announcement that Netflix was buying Warner’s studio and streaming businesses, since the cable network would not be a part of that deal. But that quickly changed on Monday with Paramount’s announced bid, which includes the cable assets that Netflix doesn’t want and, if successful, opens the possibility of a combined CNN and CBS News.The management uncertainty adds to what is already a challenging time at CNN, where there was no doubt who was in charge before swashbuckling founder Ted Turner sold his company in 1996. “That era might as well be the roaring ’20s for how long ago it feels,” said Ross Benes, senior analyst at emarketer.com.The dueling bids between Paramount and Netflix now “lead to more uncertainty and greater anxiety among the current CNN staff and among those of us who served for many years as leaders of CNN under Ted,” said Tom Johnson, former CNN president in the 1990s.Paramount’s bid, which must be approved by shareholders and regulators, could be seen favorably by President Donald Trump, who is closely allied with Paramount Skydance chairman and CEO David Ellison as well as his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. But Trump has already expressed anger at the company on social media for Sunday’s “60 Minutes” report on former U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.Prior to Friday’s announcement, Warner Bros. Discovery had said it planned to spin off its cable television networks including CNN, Discovery, HGTV, the Food Network and TLC, into a separate company. The growth of streaming has made cable networks an unattractive business.CNN’s television ratings have tumbled to the extent that it is firmly the third-rated cable news network behind Fox News Channel and MS NOW, formerly MSNBC. Its CEO, Mark Thompson, has aggressively moved into digital with a new subscription service and said that management of Discovery Global, the spinoff company, has already approved a 2026 budget investing in the plan.“I know this strategic review has been a period of inevitable uncertainty across CNN and indeed the whole of WBD,” Thompson told staff in a memo Friday. “Of course, I can’t promise you that the media attention and noise around the sale of our parent will die down overnight. But I do think the path to the successful transformation of this great news enterprise remains open.”Thompson had no additional comment on Monday, a spokeswoman said.Since Paramount’s takeover of CBS News this past summer, the network has taken steps to appeal to more conservative viewers with the installation of Free Press founder Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief. Weiss is moderating a prime-time discussion this weekend with Erika Kirk, widow of slain "

        "fullContent": "Blog > How Two Entrepreneurs Used TikTok and Trends to Create a Viral LaunchContents:Share:The COVID-19 pandemic is typically thought of as a time that was hard on business — and with good reason. Many brick-and-mortar stores struggled to stay afloat during lockdown, and online business owners or service providers had to deal with dramatic drops in sales.Nat Delaney-John, of Melbourne, Australia, found her own business struggling as the result of a long, drawn-out lockdown. But this difficult time wound up leading to a spark of an idea — a game that would bring people together again in person, spreading joy once lockdowns ended.Today, Delaney-John and her partner, Cam Jasson, are known as the creative forces behind That Sound Game, a party-ready game that’s entirely unlike anything else you might have played before.“In the party game space, there’s Charades where you act and Pictionary where you draw,” Jasson said. “But we felt there was a massive gap. We thought, why isn’t there a sound-based game?”When playing That Sound Game, participants draw cards with words on them — and then, like in Charades, they have to act out the word in a way their teammates will recognize. The catch is, though, that players can only make sounds and move their bodies. No hand gestures are allowed.That Sound Game is a fast paced, interactive and very noisy party game. The goal is to get your team to guess as many answers on the category cards as they can in a minute. Use any combination of sounds and movements, but your hands must be behind your back. You also get Lifelines. Use them strategically to help you win.Jasson and Delaney-John spent much of Melbourne's long, 250+ day lockdown working out how their game should be played.“We were just in our apartment making different sounds to each other,” Jasson said. “The rule was that if we had an idea for a card, but couldn’t make the sounds ourselves, the card couldn’t go in the game.”For the next two years, the two worked on their game in private, narrowing down a list of possible cards and sounds, creating game categories, and developing rules. As they worked, Melbourne’s lockdown restrictions eased to allow some limited travel.And finally, in October 2021, Jasson and Delaney-John’s world fully reopened.It was time to play That Sound Game with other people.The process of taking That Sound Game from the kitchen table to homes around the world had several stages.First, Jasson and Delaney-John played their game with friends. After 20 play-throughs, they felt that they’d firmed up their idea enough to take a prototype to PAX, one of the biggest gaming conventions in Melbourne.“We knew we felt it could be successful, but when you bring it to other people and they start clicking with it, when they say it’s so fun and they want to play it again — that feels amazing,” Jasson said. “It was really rewarding.”Based on PAX attendees’ feedback and positive reception to the game, the creators decided to skip attempting a crowdfundin"

After identifying relevant content, our systems aim to prioritize those that seem most helpful. To do this, they identify signals that can help determine which content demonstrates expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.”In SEO, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness are the most important signals of “helpful content” - along with the extra ‘E’ in EEAT, experience.Google wants to reward content written by experts who draw on real-world experience. And this is the kind of content that readers love, too.That’s because experts are best placed to provide factual information in an easily digestible format. They naturally use related terms to touch on new concepts that the reader will find helpful.And 72% of marketers say the most effective SEO tactic is publishing high-quality content.So when you use semantic keywords (sometimes called LSI keywords), you’re proving to RankBrain that you know what you’re talking about. These keywords are a framework for more detailed, rounded content that readers are more likely to bookmark or share.Get search volumes, trends, and opportunities – all completely free.Before we move on, remember that semantic keywords are just one part of the story. You need to use them while demonstrating EEAT.As Marie Haynes says:“If you are lacking EEAT, I suspect that tweaking your text to look better to vector search will not do much.”That means you need to build a reputation over time. Just adding keywords to thin content will no longer get results.Now we understand more about semantic keywords and EEAT, it’s time to look at ways to find and check those keywords.When experienced writers create content, they naturally branch out into related topics and mention related terms and concepts to supp"

With reduced SERP visibility, getting decent clickthrough rates is even more challenging.That said, organic search still remains the number 1 traffic channel for the majority of successful brands. That includes us:So despite the evolving nature of search, SEO success is still very much possible.But consistently driving over ~65% of our traffic purely from organic channels would be needlessly harder without the advanced SEO tools we use.Whether we're in the search for the right keyword opportunities, backlink gaps, or discovering technical SEO issues, it all comes down to making good use of the best SEO tools available to us.Let's take a look at the tools my team uses to grow and maintain our organic traffic and why these tools are perfect for the evolving search ecosystem.   Pro tip: Create a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) so you can try out the Semrush tools I've recommended in this guide.Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool provides in-depth data on search terms.If you've already used the Exploding Topics free keyword research tool, you'll be familiar with the way Semrush works (since our tool uses the same database as Semrush).Our keyword research tool shows you instant keyword insights.

This is one example of how Semrush is adding new features to provide insights you can use to evaluate your ranking potential, based on your website's authority categorization.To evaluate multiple keywords at once, go to the “Bulk Analysis” tab and enter your additional terms.This allows you to compare terms side by side. You can then pick which keywords you want to focus on.My team uses the same method to qualify keywords during topic research.Some things to consider when looking at a keyword:If the answer to both of these questions is “yes,” the keyword will drive traffic, and you stand a good chance of ranking for it.Use trending keywords to create content your audience craves.Semrush also has the Keyword Magic Tool for when you want to research keywords deeper and find the best terms related to your seed query. For each keyword, you’ll see:From the top menu, you can filter the results by keyword match types, search volume, language, and other criteria.(Keyword match types are"

One study found that 73% of marketers already use AI tools on a regular basis.AI is already a mainstay in many marketing departments in the US.Notably, Google searches for \"AI marketing tools\" have increased by 967% over the past 24 months. Search volume for \"AI marketing tools\" since late 2022.Here are a few practical ways that AI is being used for marketing:1. Ideation and brainstorming: ChatGPT and other LLMs can help come up with ideas for new campaigns, ad creatives and more. 2. Content creation: User-friendly platforms like Midjourney and DALL-E make it so any member of a marketing team can create ad copy or even social media images. Example of a marketing image created with DALL-E.3. Campaign analysis: Analyzing campaigns once tool days or weeks. Much of this work can now be done in minutes with generative AI. For example, marketers can upload a spreadsheet of an email campaign containing data like open rates, click-through rates and sales. And within minutes understand which messages and user segments performed the best.4. Predictions and forecasting: With the right data, AI can help forecast future consumer interests and demand. In 2025, expect AI usage to expand into new use cases (like automated A/B testing, AI influencers and campaign management).5. Content planning and optimizationContent markers are increasingly using AI to outline, update, and optimize content. In SEO, LLMs can be used for topic clustering and keyword planning.The introduction of AI in search engine results has huge implications for websites relying on organic traffic. Interest in the search term \"answer engine optimization\" skyrocketed in November 2024. And this trend is continuing to rise rapidly in 2025.Search interest for \"Answer engine optimization\" has been climbing since late 2024.There are a few reasons behind this.First, AI Overviews have spiked in frequency since the March 2025 Google Update.In a recent analysis, Mark Williams-Cook used 155,000 queries and found 80% of them triggering AI Overviews in Google.Google also started experimenting with a new AI Mode integrated into Google search. This appears as a separate tab at the top of SERPs. In AI Mode, Google is using a custom version of Gemini 2.0 which aggregates information from multiple related searches for more comprehensive results.The results are a combination of AI-generated text, citations, web links, and images.Altho"

        "fullContent": "Blog > Blind Boxes Boom Ahead of Black Friday as Pop Mart Revenue SoarsContents:Share:Pop Mart, maker of Labubu blind boxes, announced recently that its American revenue had increased by more than 1,200% year-over-year in Q3.The viral toys have become a must-have ahead of Black Friday and the 2025 holiday shopping season. They feature at number 10 on Google’s Holiday 100, which profiles the top-searched gifts.Meanwhile, the Labubu craze has brought blind boxes in general to greater prominence. They are now among the standout marketing strategies for this year’s Black Friday event.“Blind box” searches have increased by 1033% in the last 5 years, and the Exploding Topics algorithm forecasts further growth. Read on to find out how retail is drawing from the world of gaming to create a new kind of product that is hugely resonating with consumers. I’ll take a look at some of the biggest players in the emerging blind box space, and explore how TikTok and other social media are fueling the trend.A blind box or mystery box is a sealed package containing a surprise item. The buyer typically knows the general category of product, but the specifics are only revealed when they open the box.These boxes can be “blind” to a greater or lesser extent. Collectibles brand NECA offers boxes in the broad-brush categories of “pop culture”, “sci-fi”, and “horror”, labels that provide only minimal clues about the potential contents.“NECA” searches have increased by 31% in the last 2 years.For example, in an unboxing video for one of NECA’s pop culture blind boxes, the contents include everything from a Golden Girls figurine to an Earl Sinclair toy from the 1990s TV show Dinosaurs.The most popular example of the blind box phenomenon, the Labubu, is not really that blind at all by comparison.After all, consumers know that they will get a Pop Mart Labubu doll. The only mystery is which figurine is inside the box.But collectibles like these are highly suited to blind boxes. Despite being nominally similar, Labubus vary significantly in both desirability and value: consumers are attracted to the possibility of finding a rare item, with the guaranteed safety net of at least securing one of the figurines.The most sought-after Labubus have sold for in excess of $10,000 on the resale market. One giant Labubu sold for $170,000 at a specialist auction event in Beijing.Labubu blind boxes have proved massively lucrative for their Chinese seller, Pop Mart.The retailer has actually had a permanent presence in the US since September 2023, when it launched a store at the American Dream Mall in New Jersey.But the recent success of its Labubus has enabled significant further expansion. On October 27, the newest physical Pop Mart location was launched at the Mall of America in Minnesota.There are now around 40 Pop Mart stores in the US (compared to roughly 400 in China).While down from an August peak of nearly 100,000, “Pop Mart store” still receives more than 40,000 searches per month.

Sure, organic traffic still matters and it can still drive traffic and conversions, but if you don’t have at least one eye on your AI share of voice, you’re missing a giant opportunity.Why?According to Semrush research, AI search visitors are projected to surpass traditional search visitors by early 2028. Some industries may see this tipping point even sooner.In addition, OpenAI plans to hit 1 billion ChatGPT users by the end of 2025. And according to our most recent ChatGPT data, that’s likely to happen. Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini are all also seeing rapid adoption as people shift how they search for information.And don’t forget Google’s AI Mode, which completely replaces traditional search results with an AI-generated conversational experience.By focusing on how often you’re appearing in LLMs (a.k.a. your AI share of voice) now, you’ll be prepared rather than blindsided when your traditional organic traffic keeps declining as more searchers move to LLMs.\n  input[type=\"range\"]::-webkit-slider-thumb {\n    -webkit-appearance: none;\n    appearance: none;\n    width: 20px;\n    height: 20px;\n    background: #ff7c00;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    border: none;\n  }\n  \n  input[type=\"range\"]::-moz-range-thumb {\n    width: 20px;\n    height: 20px;\n    background: #ff7c00;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    border: none;\n  }\nFind out how many clicks you're losing to Google's AI OverviewsAI share of voice measures how often a brand appears in AI-generated search results or conversational responses compared to competitors.

Note, the most optimistic forecast for now remains Oppenheimer's 8,100 prediction. \n     One of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters and biggest bulls, Lee advised investors to buy stocks during pandemic lows and nailed the 2023 bull market. For 2025, Lee initially had forecast 6,600 finish before increasing to 7,000. \n     \"We think the way to look at 2026 is there's a wall of skepticism and a new Fed and that gets us roughly to a 10% gain,\" he said in a video update, adding that a new Fed won't want to kill the bull market. \n     At the top of that wall of worry are investor concerns that stocks can't follow three years of back-to-back gains of 20% or more with even more gains. But Lee said that since 1928, the index has gained an average 12% in the fourth year following those three years, which he said would be \"pretty good.\" \n     He sees a path for 2026 similar to 2025, with periods of volatility until a year-end rally kicks in. He said that is also how things have played out historically in cases of three back-to-back years of 20%-plus gains. \n     AI valuations, a possible adjustment time that may be needed to used to a new Fed chair, fears of social unrest and the likelihood that the Supreme Court will strike down U.S. tariffs are also on that a wall of worry for investors, Lee said. \n     But markets are also yet to price in a dovish Fed for next year, another tailwind for stocks. \n     The biggest drivers of earnings and growth in Lee's opinion will be AI and energy infrastructure, Wall Street moving onto the blockchain - think tokenization of equities, credit and real estate - and on-shoring. \n     Lee's favorite sectors headed into 2026 are technology, including AI, bitcoin and Ethereum, plus beaten down basic materials, energy and financials. (Lee is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR).) \n     Fundstrat has shifted to overweight from neutral on materials and energy, and dropped to neutral from overweight on consumer discretionary. Eaton (ETN), GE Vernova (GEV), Bloom Energy (BE), Albemarle (ALB), MP Materials (MP) and AngloGold (AU) are among their stock ideas for the sectors they like. \n     He thinks more Fed cuts could boost underperfoming financials, with . American Express (AXP), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Robinhood (HOOD) and Ally Financial (ALLY) among names they like. \n     As for crypto, he thinks 2026 will break a four-year h"

        "fullContent": "\n  By Jeffry Bartash \n     Holiday exaggerates rise in unemployment filings \n     Layoffs are low historically even though the labor market is in a hiring freeze of sorts. \n     The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits after Thanksgiving jumped to a three-month high, but the increase was exaggerated by the holiday and there's little evidence of rapidly rising U.S. layoffs. \n     Initial jobless claims rose by 44,000 in the seven days that ended Dec. 6 to 236,000, up from a more than three-year low of 192,000 in the prior week. The numbers are seasonally adjusted. \n     Jobless claims tend to gyrate during the holiday season, between Thanksgiving and early in the new year. That's exactly what has happened during the past few weeks. \n     Many businesses hire temporary help and then let the workers go. Some people who are laid off before a holiday also wait until after the holiday to apply for benefits. \n     The four-week average of new claims gives a more accurate view of what economists call churn in the labor market. Monthly claims moved up slightly to 216,750 - a level that's still historically low - from 214,750. \n     While most companies are no longer adding staff, they aren't cutting many jobs, either. Economists refer to this trend as a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market. \n     Key details: The number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, fell by almost 100,000 to 1.84 million. \n     These figures are two weeks old, however, and reflect the Thanksgiving week. Continuing claims are likely to return to previous levels in next week's report. \n     Continuing claims have risen in the past few years to a postpandemic high, but they appear to have stabilized in the past few months. \n     Big picture: Businesses are unlikely to hire lots more workers anytime soon. They are still coping with the higher costs of U.S. tariffs and are exploring ways to use artificial intelligence to reduce the need for labor. \n     The Federal Reserve, for its part, is trying to prevent unemployment from rising any further. The central bank cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third meeting in a row to try to stabilize a shaky labor market. \n     Looking ahead: \"Taking the past few weeks together, claims remain relatively low despite a recent uptick in layoff announcements,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \n     Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and S&P 500 SPX were set to open mixed in Thursday trading. \n     -Jeffry Bartash \n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

        "fullContent": "\n  By Robb M. Stewart \n  OTTAWA--Household debt in Canada expanded slightly in the third quarter, even as Canadians accumulated financial wealth thanks to equity-market gains. \n  The ratio of household credit market debt to personal disposable income widened 0.4 percentage points on the quarter before to 176.7% in the July to September period, a fourth consecutive quarterly advance, Statistics Canada said Thursday in its quarterly report on national balance sheets. \n  That means households owe an average of 1.77 Canadian dollars, the equivalent of roughly $1.28, for every dollar of after-tax income they earn. While up, it remains below the record C$1.88 in the third quarter of 2022. \n  The data agency said total household credit-market debt, including consumer debt and mortgage and non-mortgage loans, grew 1.0% in the latest quarter. Mortgages accounted for almost three quarters of debt. \n  The rise in debt outpaced a 0.8% rise in disposable income. \n  Many Canadians built up savings and paid down debt during the pandemic, though overall household debt levels in the country have remained high for years. The household saving rate ticked up to 4.7% in the third quarter. \n  The household debt-service ratio, which is measured as total obligated payments of principal and interest in credit market debt as a proportion of household disposable income, eased to 14.64% in the latest quarter from a revised 14.68% the prior quarter, as declining mortgage interest payments were more than offset by obligated principal payments. \n  The Bank of Canada this week left its policy interest rate unchanged following back-to-back cuts, though it continues to expect tepid growth for the economy. Following a stronger-than-anticipated rebound in activity in the third quarter, the central bank still expects weak growth in the final quarter and maintains a forecast for soft growth of 1.1% next year. \n  Household net wealth for the quarter increased by roughly C$460.5 billion, or 2.6%, to C$18.394 trillion. That represented an eighth straight quarterly increase, and the largest gain in wealth since the first quarter of 2024. It came due to the rebound in gross domestic product for the period, and as financial assets were boosted by the continued rally in equity markets. \n  National net worth, which combines the value of national wealth and Canada's net foreign asset position, nudged up to C$19.382 trillion on an unadjusted basis from C$19.380 trillion the quarter before. \n  Write to Robb M.

        "fullContent": "\n  By John Y. Campbell and Tarun Ramadorai \n     A 50-year mortgage is a poor solution to America's housing crisis. What's needed are more homes. \n     A 50-year mortgage would keep homeowners in debt for longer. \n     The lower monthly payment on a 50-year mortgage comes at the expense of paying interest (rather than principal) for many more years. \n     Young Americans are struggling to get on the housing ladder.  The median first-time buyer is now 40 years old and house prices are now higher, relative to income, than at any time since the peak of the mid-2000s housing boom. \n     To buy these expensive houses, people must take out expensive mortgages - mortgage rates have doubled over the past three years, pushing many households across the country to spend well over a third of their paychecks on their mortgages. \n     To reduce the burden of mortgage payments. the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the Trump administration recently proposed 50-year mortgages - an attention-grabbing extension of mortgage maturity from the current maximum of 30 years. \n     Unfortunately, this proposal does little to solve the problem. The bottom line for the ordinary consumer is that a 50-year mortgage won't really move the needle on the cost of housing. Worse still, the product embeds hidden risks - taking on a 50-year mortgage can jeopardize a secure retirement and expose borrowers to a greater chance of ending up underwater if the price of their home falls. \n     Moving maturity from 30 years to 50 gives borrowers more time to repay the principal balance of their mortgage, so it does reduce monthly payments. What most people don't realize, though, is that the bulk of their mortgage payments aren't principal repayment - they are interest payments. \n     This means that even an eye-catching 20-year increase in mortgage maturity has only a small impact on monthly payments. Let's use a simple example to put some numbers on this. \n     The current 30-year mortgage rate is around 6.2%. On a $100,000 mortgage, this gives a monthly payment of $613. We might expect a longer 50-year mortgage to carry a higher rate, but to keep this simple, let's assume it has the same rate as the 30-year mortgage. Under this conservative assumption, the monthly payment on the 50-year $100,000 mortgage is only $72 dollars lower per month. \n     This math reveals a modest reduction in the monthly payment. The concern is that the superficial attractiveness of this product draws in unsuspecting homeowners who expose themselves to longer-term risks. The lower monthly payment on a 50-year mortgage comes at the expense of paying interest (rather than principal) for many more years. \n     Benefits and risks \n     The difficult truth is that affordable housing depends on increasing housing supply. \n     As a result, 50-year mortgage borrowers build up their home equity - an important source of retirement funding for many homeowners - far more slowly.  Slower wealth accumulation quietly"

The broad market index shed 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite pulled back 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, in contrast, rose 285 points, or 0.6%.Oracle shares tumbled 14% after the cloud computing company posted disappointing quarterly revenue and raised its spending forecast, heightening concerns about the company's debt.The report added more fuel to the debate about how quickly tech companies will be able to see returns on their AI investments. Other AI plays were also trading lower in extended trading, including Nvidia and AMD, which were each down more than 2%. CoreWeave fell 6%. The moves put a damper on the momentum garnered during the previous session, which saw the S&P 500 close just inches away from a new record after a divided Fed announced an interest rate cut for the third time this year and ruled out a rate hike. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee cut its key overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point to a 3.5%-3.75% range and signaled a slower pace of rate cuts ahead.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"'well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves\" and noted President Donald Trump's tariffs have been a driver of inflation. Along with the three major indexes finishing Wednesday's session in the green, the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks notched a record close. Smaller companies tend to benefit more from lower rates than larger companies because their borrowing costs are more closely linked to market rates. Although markets rallied toward the latter half of Wednesday's session, some investors suggest being cautious ahead given that the central bank remains in a wait-and-see mode over the path of future monetary policy.\"We're not surprised to see near term optimism in the markets given that the Fed continues to cut rates even though the economy is growing, however, we think the rose colored glasses may come off once investors realize that the path to lower interest rates may take longer — or may not materialize at all — to the extent that they believe it will,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management. F.L. Putnam Investment Management chief market strategist Ellen Hazen said that greater uncertainty regarding future interest rates and conflicting data around the state of the U.S. economy could \"lead to higher volatility and risk premia across risk markets like equities as we go into 2026.\"The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite began Thursday's session with losses.The broad market index fell 0.4% shortly after 9:30 a.m., while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.7%.

        "fullContent": "Whether or not Netflix ends up being allowed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, the drama that's unfolded so far speaks volumes.If there was any lingering doubt that the fragmented streaming market is consolidating, it was just wiped away. Late last week, industry-leading Netflix (NFLX +1.00%) made the winning bid for Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD +0.30%) streaming platforms and studio, beating out Paramount Skydance (PSKY +0.55%) and Comcast (CMCSA +2.95%) for the prized HBO and HBO Max brands.Paramount isn't simply letting go, though. On Monday, it made what it argues is a better offer for the entirety of Warner, including Warner Bros. Discovery's cable television assets. The suitor says its deal could also be completed sooner, since it wouldn't need to wait for Warner's split-up (announced in June) before proceeding.Antitrust concerns have already surfaced, with both bidders saying their plan presents the lower risk of becoming a competition-quelling monopoly. It's also possible that the Department of Justice won't like either plan well enough to allow it to proceed.Whatever awaits, the recent drama confirms that Netflix is not only the big name to beat in the streaming business, but that it's setting the tone and pace for the entire industry. That bodes well for current and prospective shareholders.Netflix's offer values Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming business and studio at $72 billion, after absorbing nearly $11 billion in debt. That's for a studio currently turning about $12 billion in annual revenue into EBITDA in the ballpark of $2 billion, and a streaming business that turned a little over $10 billion in annual sales into $677 million worth of operating profit last fiscal year. It would also bring IP like Warner's Batman and Superman, Game of Thrones, and Looney Tunes to the table.Notably, Netflix's offer didn't include Warner's television assets, like CNN, Animal Planet, TNT, or Discovery, which generated more than $20 billion in revenue last year, and just over $8 billion in EBITDA. That's not the case with Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion offer, which is for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery as it stands today.For perspective, Netflix is currently turning roughly $45 billion in yearly revenue into income on the order of $11 billion, versus an adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion on $39.3 billion in sales for Paramount last fiscal year.There's one stark difference between these two entertainment companies' results. Netflix's business continues to grow, while Paramount Skydance's is on the defensive. Of course, both companies could still do something impressive with Warner's intellectual property and brand names, even if we don't yet know exactly what that might be -- that is, if the DOJ's antitrust arm allows either deal to go through.Given the rhetoric right now, Netflix's odds of ending up owning Warner's streaming assets and studio are arguably somewhere in the ballpark of 50/50. Paramount's are only slightly better, however. It al"

        "fullContent": "These stocks have rewarded shareholders generously in the last few years. The underlying businesses, on the other hand, leave much to be desired.Quantum computing is an investing theme that has delivered massive returns for shareholders. In the last three years, the big four pure-play quantum stocks -- IonQ (IONQ 3.50%), Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT 3.58%), Rigetti Computing (RGTI 4.06%), and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 2.84%) -- have all generated at least 500% cumulative stock returns.Catalyzed by an optimistic tone in the business world around quantum computing technology, these stocks have investors betting on a quantum revolution changing the world. With the stocks dipping from highs set in October of this year, should you buy quantum computing stocks as we get ready to flip the calendar to 2026?The answer is clear if you look at the underlying financials.When business leaders such as Nvidia founder Jensen Huang say quantum computing is reaching an inflection point, you can understand why these pure-play stocks are getting so much hype.Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics to exponentially improve processing power over traditional computers, promising users immense computing capabilities that are limited by even the most advanced computers today. These include technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).Companies like IonQ have research labs dedicated to commercializing quantum computing, as it could be a game changer for the computing world (and society as a whole). It is building hardware and software for quantum computing projects.However, given that current quantum computers are highly unstable and can generally only operate in extreme cold and extremely clean environments, they are expensive and not reliable for everyday tasks. This has prevented the full commercialization of the technology and has remained a bottleneck for years.Image source: Getty Images.Telling the story of disrupting the entire computing industry is enticing, which is why a stock like IonQ is up 1,000% in the last three years and has a market cap of $19 billion.But if you actually look at the underlying business, you will be greatly disappointed. Through the first nine months of 2024, IonQ generated $68 million in revenue. That is a tiny fraction of its current market value. On this revenue, it posted an operating loss of $405 million. Just looking at stock-based compensation, the company had over $200 million in share-based employee expenses, or more than 200% of its revenue.Or, we can look at Quantum Computing, Inc., which generated just $384,000 in revenue last quarter. That's not a typo. The stock currently has a market cap of $2.9 billion, giving it a trailing price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of over 3,000. That is one expensive stock. These are horrendous financial figures. This is why companies like IonQ are raising a boatload of funds through share offerings, which have grown their shares outstanding by 77% in the last three years, diluting existing shareholders"

        "fullContent": "The Invesco QQQ Trust is a great ETF to buy right now.As 2025 comes to a close, growth stocks are poised to outperform the market yet again. This dynamic has become commonplace over the past decade and a half, with growth stocks set to beat value stocks in 12 of the past 15 years.With the market being led by megacap tech stocks tied to artificial intelligence (AI), there is a good chance this outperformance will continue for the foreseeable future. AI is still in its early innings, and it's just beginning to change the world in which we live. Meanwhile, the companies leading the charge are some of the biggest companies in the world.Image source: Getty Images.Unlike the dot-com bust, which was led by unprofitable companies with often times questionable business models -- we're looking at you, Pets.com -- the AI boom is being led by profitable companies with strong balance sheets that are generating an enormous amount of operating cash flow from their core businesses. This bodes well for both the companies involved and their investors.As such, I think one of the best ways to play the AI boom is through an investment in the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.79%), which is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100. Investors can start with a smaller amount, say $2,000, but the key is to consistently invest in the fund in both up and down markets using a dollar-cost averaging strategy.If you can start with $2,000 and add $1,000 each month, you would have over $268,000 after 10 years, with a 15% average annual return. The earlier you start, the better, though, as with the same rate of return, if you held for 30 years you would have nearly $5.7 million, with 94% of that coming from gains. The Invesco QQQ Trust will give you a portfolio of the top names in tech. The Nasdaq Exchange has always been where both leading and emerging tech companies have tended to list, and the Nasdaq-100 index is certainly overweight in tech stocks. Its top 10 holdings are a who's who of tech, with most of the companies being AI leaders.Nearly 65% of the stocks in the ETF are classified as technology, and this doesn't include names like cloud computing leader Amazon and Tesla, which tend to get lumped in the consumer discretionary category. Overall, its top 10 holdings make up 55% of its portfolio.Here is a list of its top 10 holdings and weighting, as of the end of November:Data source: While actively managed funds have struggled to outperform the S&P 500 over the years, the Invesco QQQ Trust has not run into that problem. As of the end of November, the ETF has had an average annual return of 19.3% versus 14.6% for the S&P 500. While that may not sound like a lot, on a cumulative basis, it is a 486.3% return versus 291.8% for the S&P 500.

        "fullContent": "Energy Transfer looks like one of the most attractive pipeline stocks to buy today.If you're looking for a stock that can give you a combination of a high yield and strong price appreciation potential, look no further than Energy Transfer (ET 1.32%). Best of all, the stock is 20% of its recent high, making now a great time to buy.The master limited partnership (MLP) operates one of the largest integrated pipeline and midstream systems in the country. The company handles a variety of fossil fuels, including crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and refined products (such as gasoline), but its biggest area of focus is natural gas.The company is particularly well-positioned in Texas, including in the Permian Basin and the Gulf Coast. This gives it access to both cheap natural gas and storage and transportation hubs. It also makes it one of the midstream companies best positioned to take advantage of growing energy needs stemming from artificial intelligence (AI).Tech companies are not the only ones set to benefit from the expansion of AI infrastructure. Training AI models and running inference is very energy-intensive, so companies are looking to power new data centers with cheap energy sources. This is why many AI data centers are being built in Texas and the Southwest, as these areas are in close proximity to the Permian Basin. The Permian is the most prolific oil basin in the U.S., but its wells also produce natural gas that drillers are largely looking to dispose of. This makes the area one of the cheapest sources of natural gas in the country.Energy Transfer has one of the largest natural gas gathering, processing, and takeaway pipeline systems in the region, positioning it to provide both data center operators and utilities with affordable natural gas from the Permian. This is creating attractive growth project opportunities.Its most important project is the Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which will move natural gas from the Permian to markets in Texas. The company has said the pipeline will likely become its most valuable asset, which is saying a lot for a company the size of Energy Transfer. It's also building another large pipeline called the Desert Southwest pipeline that will transport natural gas into the Arizona and New Mexico markets, and it has multiple direct projects with data center builders and operators, including Oracle, Cloudburst, and Fermi. Both this year and next, Energy Transfer will spend nearly $10 billion on growth capital expenditures (capex), with the company projecting to get mid-teen returns. That should help propel growth in the coming years, with these projects set to add about $1.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) once they ramp up. Image source: Getty Images.As investors wait for Energy Transfer growth projects to come online to drive growth, they can collect the stock's robust quarterly distribution of $0.3325 per unit, which equates to a 7.9% forward yield.

        "fullContent": "CEO Anthony Noto just made a bold statement about SoFi's future.SoFi (SOFI +0.97%) has been one of the most impressive growth stories in the market. The banking disruptor added more than 900,000 members in the third quarter alone, its highest number of additions ever, and revenue grew by 38% year over year, an acceleration over last year's already strong momentum. Plus, profits have been much stronger than experts had predicted, and the company is finding innovative ways to grow while managing risk at the same time.CEO Anthony Noto has said that he hopes to scale SoFi into a \"top 10\" financial institution. Currently it's No. 53, according to the Federal Reserve's latest data. To crack the top 10, it would need to roughly 10X its asset size (for context, Bank of New York Mellon (BNY 0.20%) is currently No. 10). Image source: SoFi.Recently, Noto's comments have called for even more aggressive growth. In May, Noto said that his goal is to have 50 million members by 2030, with a total of 150 million products between them. SoFi members currently have about 18.6 million products, so this implies more than 700% growth in less than five years. Then, at a recent investment conference, Noto gave a jaw-dropping prediction by saying that SoFi's ambition is to become a trillion-dollar company. There is no bank stock in the United States that has reached a trillion-dollar valuation yet, so this is a bold target. Just to put the numbers into perspective, a trillion-dollar market cap would be about 31 times SoFi's current valuation. Could this fast-growing fintech get there?To be sure, SoFi is still in the early stages of growth. Its membership base is growing at a 35% rate, and the company's unaided brand awareness in the United States is less than 10%. To say there's still room to expand is an understatement, and I don't think the goal of 50 million members and 150 million products is unreasonable. Bank of America has about 70 million customers between consumers and small businesses, and it's not uncommon for a bank's customer base to average three to four products per person.Several potential catalysts could continue to drive SoFi's business growth and ultimately lead to a trillion-dollar valuation.For one thing, SoFi's lending business isn't just growing -- it's evolving. The company is focusing on its loan platform business, which includes originating loans on behalf of third parties, packaging loans for sale to investors, and referring loan customers to other companies, thereby generating fee income.Student loans are a big potential growth area, especially if the Department of Education moves forward with its plans to privatize parts of the $1.7 trillion federal student loan program. SoFi has the tech stack in place to become a major student loan service provider (after all, the company started as a private student lender).Furthermore, SoFi is rolling out innovating and engaging products that could serve to grow its ecosystem and revenue base.

        "fullContent": "The biggest red flag for Wall Street's artificial intelligence (AI) darlings may come from within.For the better part of the last three years, no trend has garnered more investor attention or capital on Wall Street than artificial intelligence (AI). Giving software and systems the tools to make split-second decisions and empowering them to become more efficient at their tasks over time, all without the need for human intervention, is a potential game changer for a host of industries around the globe.Arguably, no two companies have been bigger beneficiaries of the rise of AI than graphics processing unit (GPU) titan Nvidia (NVDA 2.71%) and data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (PLTR +3.34%). Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia has added more than $4 trillion in market value, while shares of Palantir have skyrocketed by over 2,700%.Although investors are expecting more of the same in 2026, the actions of those who know Nvidia and Palantir best tell a different story.Image source: Getty Images.What's allowed these two goliaths to stand out is their seemingly sustainable moats, which are hard to come by on Wall Street.Nvidia's GPUs act as the brains of AI data centers and are the undisputed top choice by businesses. According to some analysts, Nvidia's chips account for more than 90% of all GPUs currently deployed in AI-accelerated data centers. Even more important, Nvidia's AI hardware is unrivaled in terms of its compute abilities. Despite growing external competition, Nvidia's three most prominent generations of GPUs (Hopper, Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra) are superior to other chips, which is allowing Nvidia to charge a premium price of $30,000 to $40,000 for each of its high-end GPUs. This has translated into a sky-high gross margin that's approaching the mid-70% range.Don't overlook Nvidia's CUDA platform, either. This is the software toolkit developers use to maximize the compute potential of their Nvidia GPUs, including the building and training of large language models. CUDA is ensuring that businesses remain loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products and services.Meanwhile, Palantir Technologies' AI- and machine learning-powered Gotham and Foundry software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms lack one-for-one replacements at scale.Gotham is Palantir's SaaS platform that assists in the planning and execution of military missions for the U.S. government and its allies. Many of the contracts Gotham secures cover four or five years, resulting in highly predictable operating cash flow. This is also the segment that generates the lion's share of Palantir's profit.Foundry is the company's subscription-based platform that helps businesses make sense of their data. Since it's a relatively new segment, compared to Gotham, it's expected to generate substantial revenue growth for the foreseeable future.But when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street -- even for Wall Street's AI darlings -- they often are.Image source: Getty Images.Although every "

        "fullContent": "This little token is still a divisive investment.XRP's (XRP 2.72%) price set a record high of $3.65 on July 17, 2025. That marked a gain of more than 480% over the previous 12 months. But today, it trades at about $2.XRP initially rallied as it overcame some of its biggest regulatory hurdles, but a lack of clear near-term catalysts dampened that initial enthusiasm. So could this volatile token bounce back and set fresh highs over the next three years?Image source: Getty Images.XRP was created by the founders of Ripple Labs, a fintech company that specialized in blockchain-based payments, in 2012. Those founders pre-minted its entire supply of 100 billion tokens on the XRP Ledger prior to its debut, so it can't be actively mined or staked like other cryptocurrencies.Ripple initially held 80 billion of those tokens, but it sold some of those coins to fund its own expansion. That unusual capital-raising strategy triggered a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which accused Ripple of selling unlicensed securities in 2020. That lawsuit caused Ripple to lose many of its top customers, and XRP was delisted from the top crypto exchanges. That's why its price stayed below $1 throughout most of 2020 to 2024.But this August, that lawsuit finally concluded with a lighter-than-expected fine for Ripple. The court ruled that XRP wasn't an unlicensed security when it was sold to investors on public exchanges, but that it still qualified as one when it was sold to institutional investors.After the SEC backed off, the top crypto exchanges relisted XRP and several asset management firms submitted their applications for XRP spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Those first ETFs -- including Bitwise XRP (XRP 2.49%) and Canary XRP ETF (XRPC 2.44%) -- were cleared to start trading in late November.Ripple, which doesn't directly control the XRP Ledger but still serves as XRP's main platform, also submitted its application for a U.S. bank charter this July. If Ripple expands and evolves into a full-fledged digital bank, XRP could be more widely used for financial transactions.Yet XRP still isn't widely used for mainstream payments. Instead, it's mainly used as a bridge currency to accelerate certain financial transactions on Ripple. If a user wants to make a financial transaction across two different fiat currencies, they're both instantly converted to XRP (as a \"bridge\") on its ledger and back to the fiat currencies to shorten the transaction time. That method is cheaper and faster than traditional SWIFT transfers because the two fiat currencies don't need to be directly converted to each other.But XRP can't be mined with powerful computer chips like Bitcoin (BTC 1.72%), and its ledger doesn't natively support smart contracts -- which are used to develop decentralized applications (dApps) and other crypto assets -- like Ethereum (ETH 3.98%). It only natively supports lightweight \"hooks\" which are used to create simpler applications on its block"

While quantum computers offer intriguing real-world utility, IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, and Quantum Computing Inc. have issued a $926 million warning to Wall Street, which investors would be wise not to ignore.Image source: Getty Images.In simple terms, quantum computing involves the use of specialized computers to solve complex problems that classical computers either can't handle or wouldn't be able to complete during our lifetime. Quantum computers offer the potential to:This snippet of the real-world utility of quantum computing solutions is what has Boston Consulting Group believing this technology can create up to $850 billion in global economic value by 2040. A figure this large suggests a laundry list of companies can be winners. Investors have also been encouraged by the early stage commercialization of quantum computers. Both Amazon's Braket service and Microsoft's Azure Quantum platform are giving their clients access to IonQ's and Rigetti's quantum computers to run simulations, among other tasks.In mid-October, quantum computing pure-play stocks briefly went parabolic after JPMorgan Chase announced the launch of its $1.5 trillion Security and Resiliency Initiative, which will see the company make direct and venture capital investments of up to $10 billion in select companies.

        "fullContent": "The market may be generally overvalued, but you can still find value if you're willing to look.Warren Buffett hasn't found a lot to like in the stock market recently. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.14%) (BRK.B +0.78%) has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters. Through the first nine months of 2025, Buffett and his team of investment managers sold over $24 billion worth of equities. As a result, the company has seen its cash position climb to unprecedented levels, reaching $354 billion as of the end of the third quarter.Buffett's selling is indicative of his belief that most of the stock market is currently overvalued. The case has grown stronger and stronger each quarter as many stocks have seen their share prices climb faster than their underlying financial results. With broad market valuations climbing toward all-time highs, based on several classic metrics, it's no surprise Buffett is hoarding cash at this point.However, the Oracle of Omaha has been diligent in his efforts to find new places to put at least some of that capital to work. He made approximately $14 billion in recent investments for Berkshire, sending a clear message to investors about how to invest in today's market.Image source: The Motley Fool.Through the first nine months of 2025, Buffett and the team of investment managers at Berkshire Hathaway made a total of $13.4 billion worth of equity purchases. They've also made some moves since closing the books on the third quarter. Here are three of the most notable purchases Berkshire Hathaway made recently.The total spent on those investments in 2025 is estimated to be around $14 billion. While they might look like completely disparate investments from the Oracle of Omaha, they send a clear message from Buffett when you zoom out and look at the bigger picture. It's a message investors should keep in mind in the current market.Through his transactions, Buffett has made it clear that the stock market, in general, is extremely expensive. U.S. stocks, in particular, look expensive, based on metrics such as the \"Buffett Indicator,\" which measures the total U.S. stock market capitalization as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). At the indicator's current level of around 225%, Buffett says investors are \"playing with fire.\" Similarly, the S&P 500 index has a traditional price-earnings ratio and cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio that hover around levels similar to the peak of the dot-com bubble.That doesn't mean it's impossible to find value in today's market, though. However, it might require investors to look beyond the areas they're used to, which is something Buffett's recent purchases all do.Alphabet stood out in Berkshire's most recent 13F filing -- not just because it was the only new stock purchase, and not because the holding company put around $4 billion into the stock. The reason it stood out is that Buffett has long avoided tech stocks like Alphabet. That's why many believe the purch"

        "fullContent": "For hardly the first time in its history, the company has come under the scrutiny of legal officials.A finger-wagging from state attorneys general over artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots was the catalyst behind a mild sell-off of Microsoft (MSFT +0.05%) stock on Wednesday. While this isn't the first, or the most serious, regulatory issue the company has faced, it wasn't helping sentiment on the tech giant. It contributed to Microsoft's nearly 3% decline in share price that day. That morning, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general sent a letter to several major tech companies -- including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google, and Apple -- warning them that their AI-enhanced chatbots were causing problems. Image source: Getty Images.The legal officials aimed to \"communicate our serious concerns about the rise in sycophantic and delusional outputs to users emanating from the generative artificial intelligence software promoted and distributed by your companies, as well as the increasingly disturbing reports of AI interactions with children.\"The attorneys general added that these factors \"indicate a need for much stronger child-safetyand operational safeguards. Together, these threats demand immediate action.\"The recipients were requested to allow independent auditing of these products by state and federal authorities.The effort is part of a tug-of-war between the states and the federal government regarding AI oversight. The Trump administration aims to restrict states from enacting their own laws on it, while certain officials, such as the authors of the letter, would like to place some limits on the technology.As mentioned, Microsoft has found itself on the business end of regulatory pushes before. It has always found a way to either gain compliance or settle for a compromise that doesn't significantly harm its business. While we can expect some level of legal and regulatory oversight to cover AI products in the near future, I believe that, regardless, Microsoft will find a way to operate effectively.Eric Volkman has positions in Apple.

        "fullContent": "Carlo Franco / Getty Images Living the American Dream now costs just over $5 million dollars. That’s the lifetime household price tag Investopedia calculated for eight pillars of classic American middle-class aspiration, from homeownership and retirement, to weddings, kids, and brand new cars. \nInvestopedia The “American Dream” concept was first coined in 1931 by the writer James Truslow Adams in his book, Epic of America, describing the potential for all U.S. citizens to live an increasingly abundant life. As Adams wrote, “...that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.\" \n While millions have embraced and pursued the American Dream over the past century, the economic reality of paying for it today has become increasingly difficult for many.\n To put today’s price tag on the components of the American Dream, Investopedia’s data journalism team used the most recent data available from sources including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic Policy Institute, and industry research organizations, and applied them to each of the following categories:\n While everyone's specific version of living \"the American Dream\" varies in price and components, Investopedia’s most recent survey of American adults finds that the milestones a majority of respondents deem important align with the eight categories selected for the analysis.\n What is the right amount of money needed to retire comfortably today? The answer depends on how much it will cost to be the \"you\" that you want to be when you stop earning a regular income. But to afford the average annual expenditure of $63,609 for adults aged 65 and older for 20 years of retirement, you’ll need more than $1.6 million in retirement savings. That accounts for a 2.5% annual increase in inflation over a two-decade span.\n According to our survey, access to quality healthcare proved to be among the most important components of the American Dream, with 86% of respondents selecting it as part of their dream. The $414,208 needed for access to quality healthcare is the sum of the average estimated amount one person would need on an annual basis for their entire adult life, from ages 22 to 85.\n Healthcare costs rose at a 5 to 6% annual level over the past two decades, outpacing most other consumer expenditures as the cost of everything from health insurance to hospital care and medicine continues to rise. In fact, the average cost of long-term care, like a nursing home, now tops $100,000 per year, far more than most Americans could hope to afford for themselves, let alone loved ones.\n A steady rise in home prices alongside high mortgage rates has made the dream of homeownership costlier than ever. With the median price for a single-family home now at approximately $415,000 in 2025. Even with a 20% down payment, a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.69% would ultimately cost the homebuyer nearly double the purchase price to pay"

For the first time, the release also includes estimates of employer firms by owner characteristics, industry sector and congressional district.The data come from two sources: the Annual Business Survey (ABS), which covers employer businesses (those with paid employees), and the Nonemployer Statistics by Demographics (NES-D), which covers nonemployer businesses (those without paid employees). Together, they provide the most complete picture yet of U.S. business owner demographics.According to the 2024 ABS, which covers reference year 2023, there were approximately 5.9 million U.S. employer firms — 1.4 million (22.9%) were owned by women and 261,000 (4.4%) by veterans.This release also includes demographic data by urban and rural classification, employment size, receipt size, and each firm’s number of years in business:The ABS is sponsored by the National Science Foundation's National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics  (NCSES) and conducted jointly with the Census Bureau. It measures research and development for microbusinesses, innovation and technology, and provides annual data on select economic and demographic characteristics of businesses and business owners by sex, ethnicity, race and veteran status. The NCSES is set to release more data on research and development and innovation in the coming months.According to the new 2023 NES-D there were 30.4 million U.S. nonemployer businesses, with $1.8 trillion in receipts. Women owned 12.9 million (42.3%) of them and had $423.1 billion in receipts, and veteran-owned firms made up about 1.4 million (4.5%) of nonemployer businesses, with $65.7 billion in receipts.Other highlights:This release also includes business owners’ urban and rural classification, receipt size of firm, and legal form of organization (e.g., sole proprietorships and partnerships).The NES-D is an annual series that uses existing admin"

These statistics provide a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the U.S. economy. The data on this page are drawn from featured BEA economic accounts.\n            Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025 (April, May, and June), according to the second estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the first quarter, real GDP decreased 0.5 percent. The increase in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and an increase in consumer spending. These movements were partly offset by decreases in investment and exports.\n    \n            Personal income increased $112.3 billion (0.4 percent at a monthly rate) in July, according to estimates released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Disposable personal income (DPI)—personal income less personal current taxes—increased $93.9 billion (0.4 percent) and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $108.9 billion (0.5 percent). Personal outlays—the sum of PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments—increased $110.9 billion in July. Personal saving was $985.6 billion in July and the personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was 4.4 percent.\n\n    \n            The U.S. current-account deficit widened by $138.2 billion, or 44.3 percent, to $450.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, according to statistics released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The revised fourth-quarter deficit was $312.0 billion. The first-quarter deficit was 6.0 percent of current-dollar gross domestic product, up from 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter.\n    \n            The U.S. net international investment position, the difference between U.S. residents’ foreign financial assets and liabilities, was -$24.61 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to statistics released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Assets totaled $36.85 trillion, and liabilities were $61.47 trillion. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, the net investment position was -$26.54 trillion (revised). \n    \n            The U.S. goods and services trade deficit increased in July 2025 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. The deficit increased from $59.1 billion in June (revised) to $78.3 billion in July, as imports increased more than exports. The goods deficit increased $18.2 billion in July to $103.9 billion. The services surplus decreased $1.1 billion in July to $25.6 billion.\n    \n            Expenditures by foreign direct investors to acquire, establish, or expand U.S. businesses totaled $151.0 billion in 2024, according to preliminar"

Ecuador, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Ukraine are among the countries newly broken out from BEA’s overall services trade statistics. How much does research and development activity contribute to your state’s economy? How does that compare nationally? And how have R&D trends shifted across industries? To help answer these questions and more, the Bureau of Economic Analysis is updating and expanding R&D statistics introduced last year.\n\n\n\nA blog from BEA Director Vipin Arora\n\nA consistent theme throughout the history of BEA and its forerunners—driven by significant public and policymaker demand—is the expansion of our regional statistics. This expansion began with the publication of our first annual statistics on state income payments in 1939, and has continued since.Gross domestic product, the total value of goods and services produced within the United States minus the value of goods and services, or inputs, used in production, can be measured three different ways: 1) expenditures approach, 2) income approach, and 3) production approach.The most well-known method for computing GDP is the expenditures approach, the sum of all domestically produced goods and services sold to final users1. This…\n\n\n\nA blog from BEA Director Vipin Arora\n\nIn the alphabet soup of BEA acronyms, you’ve probably heard of GDP (gross domestic product). You might have heard of PCE (personal consumption expenditures, a fancy word for consumer spending). And you may have come across DPI (disposal personal income). But have you ever heard of RIMS II?The Bureau of Economic Analysis is streamlining our news release packages to reduce duplication and make it easier to find the information you need.We have phased out news release highlights, which began years ago as abbreviated one-page documents for delivery by fax. The highlights mostly repeated news release content. In some cases, such as U.S. Personal Income and Outlays, extra elements like charts previously included in the…The U.S. current-account deficit, which reflects the combined balances on trade in goods and services and income flows between U.S. residents and residents of other countries, widened by $35.9 billion, or 13.1 percent, to $310.9 billion in the third quarter of 2024. The widening reflected expanded deficits on secondary income, on primary income, and on goods.

The revised first-quarter deficit was $439.8 billion.The second-quarter deficit was 3.3 percent of current-dollar gross domestic product, down from 5.9 percent in the first quarter.The $188.5 billion narrowing of the current-account deficit in the second quarter primarily reflected a reduced deficit on goods.Current-Account Transactions (Tables 1–5)Exports of goods and services to, and income received from, foreign residents increased $28.6 billion to $1.27 trillion in the second quarter. Imports of goods and services from, and income paid to, foreign residents decreased $159.9 billion to $1.53 trillion.1Trade in goods (table 2)Exports of goods increased $11.3 billion to $550.2 billion, reflecting an increase in nonmonetary gold. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in industrial supplies and materials. Imports of goods decreased $184.5 billion to $820.2 billion, reflecting decreases in nonmonetary gold, in consumer goods, and in industrial supplies and materials. (See \"Additional Information\" for a definition of nonmonetary gold under \"Goods.\")Trade in services (table 3)Exports of services increased $2.1 billion to $301.6 billion, reflecting increases in financial services and in charges for the use of intellectual property. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in government goods and services. Imports of services increased $2.8 billion to $222.0 billion, reflecting increases in \"other business services,\" mainly technical, trade-related, and other business services, and in telecommunications, computer, and information services. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in transport.Primary income (table 4)Receipts of primary income (earned income) increased $17.8 billion to $376.1 billion, and payments of primary income increased $22.8 billion to $383.8 billion. The increases in both receipts and payments reflected increases in direct and portfolio investment income.Secondary income (table 5)Receipts of secondary income (current transfers) decreased $2.6 billion to $45.9 billion, reflecting a decrease in private transfers. Payments of secondary income decreased $1.0 billion to $99.2 billion, reflecting a decrease in general government transfers.Capital-Account Transactions (Table 1)Capital-transfer receipts decreased $8.9 billion to $16 million in the second quarter. First-quarter transactions reflected receipts from foreign insurance companies for losses resulting from wildfires in Southern California.

We could not produce high-quality statistics without the generous cooperation of the people who participate in our surveys. People who respond to our surveys share lots of information about themselves, their households, or the businesses where they work. They need to feel confident BLS will keep that information private and use it responsibly. Data Privacy Week is observed around the world January 27–31, 2025, to remind everyone to respect privacy, safeguard data, and enable trust. Data privacy isn’t just a 1-week observance at BLS, however; it’s our full-time job.Several laws govern how BLS protects your privacy. One is the Privacy Act of 1974, which recently turned 50 years old. The Privacy Act prohibits federal agencies from disclosing information about an individual without the individual’s written consent. The law also requires agencies to hold all personally identifying information in confidence. This includes names, addresses, and social security numbers.Another key law is the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, which we often call CIPSEA. This law requires BLS and other agencies that collect information under a pledge of confidentiality for statistical purposes to use the information for statistical purposes only. The law defines a statistical purpose as the description, estimation, or analysis of the characteristics of groups, without identifying the individuals or organizations in those groups. This means we can’t share the information with other agencies for them to use for “any administrative, regulatory, law enforcement, adjudicatory, or other purpose.” It also means we must protect the information businesses provide so other businesses can’t gain a competitive advantage.CIPSEA also has severe penalties for violating the law. Any BLS employee or agent who knowingly and willfully discloses identifiable respondent information to someone not authorized to have it can receive up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $250,000, or both.Beyond these laws, BLS has many safeguards to keep our IT systems secure and prevent confidential information from getting into the wrong hands. We constantly monitor our systems to identify and fix vulnerabilities, both from outside and inside BLS. Our staff undergoes thorough background checks, frequent training, and regular reminders about policies and procedures to safeguard the information e"

As such, they are a principal federal economic indicator and are widely used by policy makers and researchers to develop plans and policies for and conduct research on the current state of the U.S. economy.2 At the total private-sector level, average hourly earnings of all employees are simply the aggregate payrolls of all employees in all private-sector industries divided by the aggregate hours of all employees in those industries.3 Aggregate payrolls refer to the total amount of mon"

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) can show you which occupations are expected to have the most openings for new entrants with various levels of education.BLS develops 10-year employment projections for more than 800 detailed occupations. Each occupation is assigned to the education level that’s typically required for workers to enter. This article highlights the occupations that BLS projects to have the most openings each year, on average, from 2024 to 2034 for five education levels:Across all occupations, BLS projects about 19 million openings each year, on average, from 2024 to 2034. Most openings come from the need to replace workers who leave permanently, either to exit the labor force or to transfer to a different occupation. But others are from employment growth: that is, newly created jobs.Keep reading to see charts showing projected openings, along with data on median annual wages, at each of the education levels. For comparison, the median annual wage for all occupations was $49,500 in 2024. (A median wage is the point at which half of workers made more than the amount, and half made less.)The charts also include data to indicate whether workers typically need experience in a related occupation for entry and whether on-the-job training to attain competency is typically required. And for selected occupations, the text highlights BLS information about skills.BLS classifies 109 occupations as not typically needing any formal educational credential. Chart 1 shows the 10 occupations in this group that are projected to have the most openings each year, on average, from 2024 to 2034.Fast food and counter workersRetail salespersonsCashiersStockers and order fillersWaiters and waitressesLaborers and freight, stock, and material movers, handJanitors and cleaners, except maids and housekeeping cleanersCooks, restaurantMaids and housekeeping cleanersLandscaping and groundskeeping workersSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections.The occupations in chart 1 account for nearly 7 out of 10 openings projected at this education level. Fast food and counter workers is projected to have more openings than any other occupation in the economy: 904,300 each year, on average, from 2024 to 2034.

Consistent with other research, we show that, compared with public K–8 teachers with bachelor’s degrees, private early educators with similar work patterns and educational attainment earned less and lacked critical employer-sponsored benefits such as health insurance and retirement accounts.As the COVID-19 pandemic starkly illuminated, parents’ ability to work often depends on access to affordable, high-quality childcare. Indeed, some research conducted 2 years into the pandemic suggests that access to childcare may partially explain why women’s labor force participation had not yet fully recovered by that point.1 Previous analyses have also uncovered a labor shortage within the childcare sector—a shortage that continues to constrain the supply of available childcare options for parents.2 Less well appreciated is the fact that the short supply of childcare workers (also known as early educators3) long predated the COVID-19 pandemic.

The graph tells a compelling story: We’re producing more per worker in manufacturing, but with far fewer workers relative to the overall workforce.Manufacturing productivity rose strongly from the late 1980s until the Great Recession in 2008-09. During this period, workers were producing more value per hour due to advances in automation, more-efficient production processes, and improved capital equipment. At the same time, the share of manufacturing workers in the total nonfarm workforce has been shrinking. This shows that even as factories are producing more, they require a smaller share of the labor force. Notably, these trends—often refereed to as structural transformation—were underway long before the China trade shock of the early 2000s.Since 2010 or so, we see that labor productivity in manufacturing has largely flattened, showing little growth compared with the period before 2010. Meanwhile, the decline in the manufacturing employment share has also slowed considerably.This divergence has large implications. First, it underscores how innovation is reshaping manufacturing. The trends displayed above are consistent with ideas surrounding automation and technology adoption. Second, it challenges notions about manufacturing being a major job engine. If productivity keeps rising while the share of manufacturing employment falls, employment gains in the economy will need to come from other sectors.How this graph was created: Search FRED for “All Employees, Manufacturing.” Above the graph on the right, click on “Edit Graph,” add a series by searching for “All Employees, Total Nonfarm,” and apply formula a/b. Open the “Add Line” tab and search for and select “Manufacturing Sector: Labor Productivity (Output per Hour) for All Workers.” Open the “Format” tab and place the legend on the right for the second line.

According to the producer price index (PPI) for residential electric power, these prices have gone up by 7% between January and August 2025. This rise in prices can be attributed to many supply and demand factors, including an aging power infrastructure and the construction of new data centers throughout the US, which are a major contributor to greater demand for electricity.Looking at the dataOur FRED graph above shows the PPI values for both natural gas and residential electric power. Since 2015, the two have generally moved together. What stands out immediately is the sharp divergence between natural gas prices and electricity prices starting around 2023.Natural gas has long been a core input for US power generation. As growth in supply outpaced demand, natural gas prices dropped significantly. Under normal circumstances, falling natural gas prices might ease wholesale electricity costs, but that relationship appears increasingly muted.The steeper increases in residential electricity prices in recent months reflect structural pressures in the power sector that go beyond fuel costs. These include the need for extensive grid and transmission upgrades, rising operational costs, and surging electricity demand from large consumers such as data centers and other power-intensive facilities.This widening gap hints at an increasingly strained electricity system, where capital investment needs and surging industrial demand are outpacing the benefits of cheaper natural gas. If these trends continue, electricity prices may remain elevated even in an environment of low fuel costs, reshaping energy planning for households, businesses, and policymakers.How this graph was created: Search FRED for and select “PPI Natural gas.” Above the graph, click “Edit Graph,” open the “Add Line” tab, and search for and add “PPI Residential electric.” Open the “Format” tab and place the legend of the second line to the right.

So, GDP and DPI are positively correlated. That is, they generally move in the same direction and follow each other closely.Our FRED graph above shows this correlation, with one striking deviation at the point of the COVID-19 pandemic. What’s behind this deviation? A third measure, personal current transfer receipts, can help explain.The US government increased transfers to households in such large proportions during the pandemic that DPI growth actually increased even though GDP growth decreased. GDP and DPIPrior to 2020, GDP and DPI show a clear positive correlation. During recessions (shaded areas in the graph), the growth rates of GDP and DPI decreased. The correlation also holds outside recessions: During the recoveries after the 1981-82 and 2007-09 recessions, the growth rates of both GDP and DPI increased.From 2020 to 2023, however, the two series behave quite differently: GDP’s growth rate decreased while DPI’s growth rate increased.DPI and TransfersAlthough GDP and DPI are closely related, there’s a difference between them: DPI includes government transfers to individuals, which is captured by the thin red line in the graph. And it’s these transfers that explain the change in the behavior of GDP and DPI in 2020.Our second FRED graph, above, zooms in on the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The US government sent transfer payments to households to alleviate the severity of the crisis. In the second quarter of 2020, transfers increased substantially and so did personal disposable income, despite the fact that GDP growth had gone negative.The growth rates of transfers and PDI then generally declined and went negative in the first quarter of 2022, despite the fact that GDP growth had been positive. By 2024, the rates were aligned once again.Why was 2020-23 so different?The US government has increased transfers to households before to alleviate the severity of crises. For example, the first graph shows an increase in transfers during the 2007-09 recession. So why did DPI growth actually increase during the COVID-related recession, but in no other recession?The increase in transfers in 2008 was only 25%, compared with 75% in 2020 and 89% in 2021. Those are proportions not seen before.

Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Luka, Meta, Nomi AI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI were also included in the letter.The letter comes as a fight over AI regulations has been brewing between state and federal government.Those safeguards include transparent third-party audits of large language models that look for signs of delusional or sycophantic ideations, as well as new incident reporting procedures designed to notify users when chatbots produce psychologically harmful outputs. Those third parties, which could include academic and civil society groups, should be allowed to “evaluate systems pre-release without retaliation and to publish their findings without prior approval from the company,” the letter states.“GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations,” the letter states, pointing to a number of well-publicized incidents over the past year — including suicides and murder — in which violence has been linked to excessive AI use, the letter states. “In many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users’ delusions or assured users that they were not delusional.”AGs also suggest companies treat mental health incidents the same way tech companies handle cybersecurity incidents — with clear and transparent incident reporting policies and procedures. Companies should develop and publish “detection and response timelines for sycophantic and delusional outputs,” the letter states.

It’s a signal of just how critical this work has become as Google pours up to $93 billion into capital expenditures by the end of 2025 — a number that parent company Alphabet expects will be a whole lot bigger next year.Vahdat isn’t new to the game. The computer scientist, who holds a PhD from UC Berkeley and started as a research intern at Xerox PARC back in the early ’90s, has been quietly building Google’s AI backbone for the past 15 years. Before joining Google in 2010 as an engineering fellow and VP, he was an associate professor at Duke University and later a professor and SAIC Chair at UC San Diego. His academic credentials are formidable — with what appears to be around 395 published papers — and his research has always focused on making computers work more efficiently at massive scale.Vahdat already maintains a high profile with Google. Just eight months ago, at Google Cloud Next, he took the stage to unveil the company’s seventh-generation TPU, called Ironwood, in his role as VP and GM of ML, Systems, and Cloud AI. The specs he rattled off at the event were staggering, too: over 9,000 chips per pod delivering 42.5 exaflops of compute — more than 24 times the power of the world’s No. 1 supercomputer at the time, he said. “Demand for AI compute has increased by a factor of 100 million in just eight years,” he told the audience.Behind the scenes, as noted by Semafor, Vahdat has been orchestrating the unglamorous and essential work that keeps Google competitive, including those custom TPU chips for AI training and inference that give Google an edge over rivals like OpenAI, as well as the Jupiter network, the super-fast internal network that allows all its servers to talk to each other and move massive amounts of data around. (In a blog post late last year, Vahdat said that Jupiter now scales to 13 petabits per second, explaining that’s enough bandwidth to theoretically support a video call for all 8 billion people on Earth simultaneously.) Vahdat has also been deeply involved in the ongoi"

But Reddit has decided that perhaps it is, actually, a good idea to verify the accounts of public figures in an attempt to mitigate the spread of misinformation. Reddit acknowledges that pseudonymity is a key part of its culture, allowing users to express themselves more openly than they would if their real name was attached to everything they say. But Reddit says that this feature is completely voluntary and opt-in. The verification feature is less so about denoting a special elite status, but making it easier for both ordinary users and subreddit moderators to quickly verify that someone is being truthful about their identity.The absence of a checkmark doesn’t mean someone is a fraud, though. Reddit is piloting this feature with a small batch of profiles, and even if the checkmarks get a full rollout, it’s still possible that some famous Redditors won’t get a check.Tony Hawk, for example, posts very casually on skateboarding subreddits, simply chatting about his favorite sport with likeminded fans. He’s just like us! But he does blow up his spot a bit when he shares his own skating videos on r/OldSkaters, because there probably aren’t many 57-year-olds doing heel flips.While Reddit’s checkmarks are in their alpha rollout, users will be eligible if they’re active contributors in good standing and “trusted partners,” which Reddit did not specify. Having a checkmark doesn’t give a user any special privileges. However, users will not be eligible for a checkmark if they are an NSFW profile, or if they primarily engage in NSFW communities. For now, Reddit is manually verifying profiles, but says it will use a third-party process in"

It was chosen by the department’s then-DEI office, which has since been disbanded under Rubio amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directives. The font was chosen in an effort to make documents easier to read for the vision impaired. Sans-serif fonts are those without decorative swirls and lines at the ends of letters. With their cleaner lines and slightly wider letter spacing, they are considered more accessible for people with issues ranging from dyslexia to low vision (although research on how much the serifs themselves impact readability has been inconclusive).  Rubio’s memo has designated Times New Roman as his tenure’s official font, stating it will “restore decorum and professionalism” to documents. Rubio did admit in the memo that Calibri wasn’t the “most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful” example of DEI to his mind’s eye, but he still berated the font for contributing to “the degradation” of the State Department’s official correspondence.  Many people across the political spectrum dislike Calibri (according to an informal survey of TechCrunch writers) but all the same, that’s a harsh criticism for a font. Apparently, there were rumblings within the department in 2023 when Calibri was first adopted, the New York Times reported. Font choices inspire the same kind of love/hate passions as sports teams. Everyone has their favorites and their rivalries. While Calibri declined to comment to TechCrunch on how woke it actually was, many people would agree that Times New Roman is a particularly old-timey font. Even the New York Times stopped using it almost two decades ago.  The State Department did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Topics\n\t\tVenture Editor\n\t\t\tPlan ahe"

It will then use infrared lasers to transmit that power to utility-scale solar farms on Earth, allowing them to send power to the grid nearly round the clock. Overview has raised $20 million to date, and part of that money has gone toward an airborne demonstration of its power-beaming technology. A light aircraft transmitted power using a laser to a ground receiver over a distance of 5 kilometers (3 miles).Investors include the Aurelia Institute, Earthrise Ventures, Engine Ventures, EQT Foundation, Lowercarbon Capital, and Prime Movers Lab.As space launch costs have declined over the past decade or so, space-based power has gone from pure science fiction to something closer to reality. There are still several hurdles to overcome: For one, it’s still significantly cheaper to deploy solar panels here on Earth than to send them into space. And the ability to send power wirelessly from orbit down to our planet’s surface is still in its infancy.Other companies are attempting the same feat. Aetherflux is also pursuing a laser-based approach. Others like Emrod and Orbital Composites/Virtus Solis are developing microwave-based power transmission, which sends energy wirelessly using a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum than Aetherflux and Overview. Microwaves are less sensitive to clouds and humidity than infrared lasers, which can’t transmit in cloudy weather since the suspended water droplets would absorb much of the energy. But because microwave-based systems can’t reuse existing solar farms, they would have to build their own ground stations. To keep costs down, those ground receivers would probably be smaller, so the energy beams would have to be tighter and more powerful. Companies are developing ways to swiftly interrupt the beam to prevent collateral damage to birds and aircraft, but it’s still a concern.Overview’s reuse of solar farms would mitigate some of those concerns, though it would still have to convince the public that energy beams from spa"

This allows parents and children to video chat with a virtual version of the jolly old Saint Nick.After signing up for a free account, users can interact with AI Santa via text, phone, or video chat. Users can tell AI Santa what they want for Christmas, share their holiday plans, and find out if they’re on the naughty or nice list. This year, the company debuted an improved version of AI Santa, designed to be more expressive and emotionally aware. Santa is now a “Tavus PAL,” the company’s name for its real-time AI agents that are built to see, hear, respond, and appear human.AI Santa can now see users’ expressions and gestures and respond to them. It also remembers users’ conversations and interests, creating a more personalized experience. Notably, it now can take actions of its own, including searching the web for present ideas or even perform everyday tasks like drafting emails.During testing, the conversation with AI Santa was engaging for the most part. When we mentioned wanting a new PlayStation for Christmas, Santa followed up with questions about our favorite video games, showing knowledge of specific titles like Baldur’s Gate 3. It also smiled back when we did. (We didn’t like that part very much, but maybe others will.)Users appear to be enjoying the improved experience so far. Founder and CEO Hassaan Raza said that many people are engaging with the platform frequently, spending hours chatting with AI Santa and often reaching their daily limits.“Last year’s AI Santa drew millions of hits, and we’re on pace to surpass that by a wide margin as Christmas approaches,” he noted.While this level of engagement marks a milestone for Tavus, it also raises questions about the impact of such interactions, especially for young children. Children may struggle to distinguish between AI and a real person. Spending hours in conversation with an AI has already been linked to negative effects in adults, making the potential effects on children who strongly believe in Santa a concern for some parents.During our testing, there were subtle cues that the AI Sant"

Last year, TIME chose President Donald Trump for the second time. The year before that, it was Taylor Swift, who many claimed saved the economy from a recession with her Eras Tour. In 1938, the magazine chose Adolf Hitler. This year, TIME has chosen to bestow its award on not just one person, but a group of people: the so-called “Architects of AI,” comprising the CEOs shaping the global AI race from the U.S. With AI on everyone’s minds, embodying hope for a small minority and economic anxiety for a majority, per recent Edelman data, this  tracks.“For decades, humankind steeled itself for the rise of thinking machines,” the article reads. “Leaders striving to develop the technology, including Sam Altman and Elon Musk, warned that the pursuit of its powers could create unforeseen catastrophe […] This year, the debate about how to wield AI responsibly gave way to a sprint to deploy it as fast as possible.”Based on one of TIME’s two cover photos, some of those people appear to be Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Tesla’s Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, AMD’s Lisa Su, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis, and World Labs’s Fei-Fei Li — all individuals who raced “both beside and against each other.” TIME writes that these individuals, through their multi-billion-dollar bets on “one of the biggest physical infrastructure projects of all time,” have reshaped government policy, turned up the heat on geopolitical competition, and pushed AI adoption forward. “This is the story of how AI changed our world in 2025, in new and exciting and sometimes frightening ways. It is the story of how Huang and other tech titans grabbed the wheel of history, developing technology and making decisions that are reshaping the information landscape, the climate, and our livelihoods… AI emerged as arguably the most consequential tool in great-power competition since the advent of nuclear weapons.”TIME only announced the news on Thursday morning, but images of the cover photo were leaked on prediction market Polymarket on Wednesday evening.BREAKING: TIME Person of the Year reportedly leaked. pic.twitter.com/oe3okxsXoZTopicsPlan ahead f"

TechCrunch then alerted Freedom Chat founder Tanner Haas to the security flaws by email.Haas confirmed to TechCrunch that the app has now reset user PINs and released a new version. Haas added that the company is removing instances where users’ phone numbers were occasionally visible, and has notched up rate-limiting on its servers to prevent mass-guess attempts.Daigle, who published his findings in a blog post, told TechCrunch it was possible to enumerate the phone numbers of close to 2,000 users who had signed up to use Freedom Chat since it launched. Daigle said Freedom Chat’s servers allowed anyone to flood it with millions of phone number guesses to determine if a user’s phone number was stored on the servers.Per Daigle, this technique is identical to one described by the University of Vienna in research last month, where academics scraped data on some 3.5 billion user accounts who signed up to WhatsApp by matching billions of phone numbers against WhatsApp’s servers.Daigle also found Freedom Chat was leaking users’ PIN codes. Using an open-source network traffic inspection tool to analyze the data going in and out of the app, Daigle saw that the app would respond with the PIN codes of every other user in the same public channel — even if the PINs weren’t visible to users within the app itself.According to Daigle, anyone who was in the default Freedom Chat channel, which users are automatically subscribed to when they first sign up, had their PIN broadcast to everyone else in the channel. Daigle told TechCrunch that knowledge of a person’s PIN could allow someone t"

Now, the startup has proven its technology works and is seeing demand from wind farms and beyond.Oslo, Norway-based Spoor has built software that uses computer vision to track and identify bird populations and migration patterns. The software can detect birds within a 2.5-kilometer radius (about 1.5 miles) and can work with any off-the-shelf high-resolution camera.Wind farm operators can use this information to better plan where wind farms should be located and to help them better navigate migration patterns. For example, a wind farm could slow down its turbines, or even stop them entirely, during heavy periods of local migration.Ask Helseth (pictured above left), the co-founder and CEO of Spoor, told TechCrunch last year that he got interested in this space after learning that wind farms lacked effective tracking methods, despite many countries having strict rules around where wind farms can be built and how they can operate due to local bird populations.“The expectations from the regulators are growing but the industry doesn’t have a great tool,” Helseth said at the time. “A lot of people [go out] in the field with binoculars and trained dogs to find out how many birds are colliding with the turbines.”Helseth told TechCrunch last week that since then, the company has proven the need for this technology and worked to make it better.At the time of its seed raise in 2024, Spoor was able to track birds in a 1-kilometer range, which has since doubled. As the company has collected more data to feed into its AI model, it has been able to improve its bird identification accuracy to about 96%.“Identifying the species of the bird for some of the clients, you add another layer,” Helseth said. “Is it a bird or not a bird? We have an in-house ornithologist to help train the model to train the new types of birds or a new type of species. Having deployment in other countries [means] having rare species in the database.”Spoor now works across three continents and with more than 20 of the world’s largest energy companies. It has also started to see interest from other industries such as airports and aquaculture farms. Spoor has a partnership with Rio Tin"

Rather than pump harder or inject something to force oil to the surface, Eclipse sends down microbes to munch on the oil molecules and liberate their hydrogen. Instead of viscous oil, companies only have to deal with hydrogen gas. “Hydrogen flows a lot easier,” Sekhon said, making it easier to extract it from the well.The Houston-based startup, which was spun out of Cemvita, demonstrated the technology at an oilfield in California’s San Joaquin Basin last summer. Now, it’s partnering with oilfield services company Weatherford International to deploy the technology around the world, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The first projects will begin in January.“They’re an extension of our team,” Sekhon said to characterize the relationship with Weatherford. “They’ll be our operational arm.”Eclipse, which was previously known as Gold H2, has been developing the technology over the last several years. It has been sampling microbes that naturally occur in oil wells, which live at the interface between oil and water held in aquifers, to find those that are best suited to the job.As the microbes consume the oil, they break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Both then flow to the surface, where Eclipse and its partners will eventually separate the two. About half of the carbon dioxide is likely to stay in the reservoir, while the other half could be captured using specialized equipment and either sequestered or used.The goal, Sekhon said, is to produce low-carbon hydrogen for around 50 cents per kilogram, or the same price as hydrogen obtained by breaking down natural gas in an industrial plant, a process that releases more carbon dioxide.The resulting hydrogen could be used in petrochemical plants or burned for energy. “It’s taking a liability and turning it into a clean energy asset,” Sekhon said.Topics\n\t\tSenior Reporter, Climate\n\t\t\tTim De Chant is"

        "fullContent": "Whether you work from home, spend a lot of time on airplanes, or simply want to turn down the volume of the outside world, noise-cancelling headphones are a worthwhile investment.Even the best value headphones will feel lacking if they don't come equipped with halfway decent noise cancellation. Besides, there are simply too many headphones on the market (our testing pool gets bigger by the month) for you to pay hundreds only to get subpar ANC.To help you wade through the top options from brands like Apple, Beats, Bose, Sony, and Sonos, Mashable editors and reviewers tested dozens of headphones and earbuds. From flagship models to budget buds, we picked out the best noise-cancelling headphones of 2025. Bose is often a top name (and in our top picks) when it comes to noise-cancelling audio, often leading the industry for the best ANC available.With that said, it's not the only brand worth checking out. If you want top-notch ANC with great sound quality, Sony makes excellent options. On the other hand, folks looking for a more affordable option might be drawn to EarFun, which brings great value to the noise-cancelling space. Essentially, what makes the best noise-cancelling headphones depends on what other features and price range you're looking for in a pair of headphones — our guide below lays out where each of our picks shines.Every single pair of headphones we included in this guide was hands-on tested by a Mashable reporter or editor. You can learn about our in-depth process by taking a look at our standardized testing methodology we developed for headphones and earbuds.We pulled these recommendations from our existing pool of headphones reviews and from hands-on testing performed specifically for this buying guide. A couple of options that didn't make our updated guide include the AirPods Max, which do have good ANC and sound quality but also a less impressive feature-to-price ratio, especially compared to options from Sony and Bose. For a condensed version of what exactly makes good noise-cancelling headphones, here's what we considered: \n                    Though we always weigh this feature when testing headphones, we paid extra attention to it for the purposes of this guide. For the headphones tested specifically for this guide, we made sure to use them indoors and outdoors, to wear them while someone was trying to speak to us, while playing loud music externally, and while going about our usual workdays.\n                \n                    Though this category can be extra subjective due to different user preferences and head and ear sizes, we also look at how adjustable headphones are in terms of suiting different wearers, whether with earbud ear tips or headphone band adjustments. A good fit can also factor in improved noise cancelling in headphones, so we made sure to pay extra close attention to how these headphones wore.\n                \n                    While testing headphones, we listen to music across a variety of genres, as"

        "fullContent": "I've been using PlayStation consoles for almost 30 years. So in this PS5 vs. PS5 Slim face off, I'll be helping you decide which console is best for you.With the recent launch of the upgraded PS5 Pro console, now might be the perfect opportunity to snag a slightly older — yet still incredibly powerful — PS5.With potential sweet deals, or even permanent price drops on the horizon, it’s essential to know exactly what you’re getting (and not getting) with the PS5 and PS5 Slim.For context, the original, non-slim PS5 has two versions: a digital one (without a disc drive) and one with a disc drive. The same can be said for the PS5 Slim; it's got a digital version and a disc one. For whatever reason, Sony decided to not drop the prices of the new PS5 Slim models. The PS5 Slim with a disc drive is still $499, while the PS5 Slim without a disc drive is $449 — or a $50 increase over the original PS5 digital-only console.PS5 Slim (no disc drive) - $449PS5 Slim (with disc drive) - $499Original PS5 (no disc drive) - $399Original PS5 (disc drive) - $499With that in mind, yes, the digital-only PS5 Slim is a money-saver in comparison to the one with a disc drive, but not in comparison to the digital-only model that launched in 2020. The new price also means that buying a digital model before purchasing the additional disc drive would cost more than just snagging the version with a built-in drive. I don't really have a good explanation for that.My only advice is this: If you want a PS5 that only costs $399, you better get one now. This is an important note: Once the existing stock of both original models sells out, the new slim models will replace them on store shelves. Obviously, size is what many gamers are most concerned about here, so let's get right to it. Looking at Sony's stated dimensions, you can see that the new PS5 is indeed smaller than the original:Original PS5 (disc version): 104mm (height) x 390mm (width) x 260mm (depth)PS5 Slim (disc version): 96mm (height) x 358mm (width) x 216mm (depth)Original PS5 (digital version): 92mm x 390mm x 260mmPS5 Slim (digital version): 80mm x 358mm x 216mmIn other words, per Sony's announcement blog post, that's about a 30 percent reduction in total volume. That's definitely an improvement, but there's some important context missing in just those raw numbers. The Verge ran a digital size comparison and discovered that both new models are still substantially larger than the Xbox Series X. In other words, this \"slim\" console is still pretty dang big.For a visual comparison, check out this awesome PS5 Slim vs. Regular Reddit post.Another important aspect of the new PS5 models to get out of the way is that they have the exact same internal capabilities as the originals. This isn't a PS4 vs. PS4 Pro situation. Games will run exactly the same across the spectrum of PS5 consoles.One little internal bonus that owners of the new PS5s get, however, comes in the form of expanded storage. For some reason, the original PS5 only h"

        "fullContent": "Apple CEO Tim Cook should be celebrating, and not just because he turned 65 in November. Instead, he's beset by questions about a retirement he hasn't announced yet — and stories about his executives heading for the exits. We'll get to the who, but first of all: Why? Why would anyone with executive-level stock options want to leave Apple right now? Cook's company may not be be the world's most valuable (after a remarkable run), but it has been growing steadily and is worth more than $4 trillion — within hailing distance of world leader NVIDIA, now that the latter's stock is sliding. By the time you read this, Apple might well be wearing the crown again. And why is Apple so resilient, such a safe, steadily increasing bet for stock pickers? Three words: global iPhone sales. The iPhone continued to massively outperform Android models in the third quarter of 2025, a report by analysts Counterpoint revealed. In fact, smartphone sales paint an picture of perpetual global popularity unlike any product before it — well, unless you count the Beatles as a product. Like the Fab Four at their height, all four models of the iPhone 16 occupy the top four slots in the top 10. (Last year, for comparison, iPhone 15 models occupied the top 3 slots). Rounding out the top 10 are the Galaxy A16 5G, four other Galaxy models, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max.That too is new. The just-released iPhone 16 models didn't penetrate the top 10 in last year's third quarter. But the just-released top-of-the-line iPhone 17 cracked the top 10 even though it had \"limited availability\" at the end of the period, Counterpoint notes. An unprecedented flurry of executive departure announcements roiled Apple in the last week, and each seemed to portend something bad for the company's direction — until you dug deeper into each one of them. First came John Giannandrea, Apple Senior VP of Machine Learning and AI. At a time when Apple Intelligence is racing to catch up (and may soon be driven by Android nemesis Google and its Gemini model), and given that Meta has poached a lot of Apple AI talent this year, that didn't sound good! But Giannandrea may not be any great loss, and not just because he's responsible for Siri in its current iteration. Check out his replacement, Amar Subramanya — one of the people responsible for releasing Google Gemini in 2023. In other words, Cook is doing exactly what you'd expect if you were forced to use Gemini for now, but really wanted to nail your in-house AI model. The fact that Subramanya was hired to work on AI at Microsoft six months ago, but left for Apple regardless, is a pretty big vote of confidence in Cook's company (especially given Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI). Then came Apple design chief Alan Dye, who gave the world Liquid Glass — the translucent icon thing in iOS 26 that has, to say the least, divided users. Dye is departing to become head of design at Meta, news which itself divided longtime Apple watchers. Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, who brok"

If you watch porn, you probably want to shield yourself from prying eyes of advertisers, your internet service provider — or even your government.As of November 2025, around half of the United States and several countries, including the UK and France, have enacted age-verification laws. Typically, these laws require visitors to sites containing explicit content to input personal data (like a government ID or facial scan) to access that material. To get around these laws, many people are using VPNs — if spikes in searches for them in areas that passed these laws are to be believed.A VPN, or virtual private network,  masks your current location, and there are plenty available, free or paid, as apps or browser extensions. \n                    \n    AdultFriendFinder\n\n                                             —\n                    readers’ pick for casual connections\n                    \n                    \n                                    \n                    \n    Tinder\n\n                                             —\n                    top pick for finding hookups\n                    \n                    \n                                    \n                    \n    Hinge\n\n                                             —\n                    popular choice for regular meetups\n                    \n                    \n                                    These networks are easy to use, but should you use a VPN to watch porn? The answer is complicated. VPNs aren't \"an anonymity cloak,\" said Yael Grauer, investigative tech reporter at Consumer Reports, despite what their marketing may say. The reality is, some scenarios are best suited for other web security tools — and it's actually possible that a VPN can weaken your safety.Rindala Alajaji, a legislative activist at the digital civil liberties nonprofit, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), compares VPNs to a P.O. box. If you send a letter and put a P.O. box as the returning address, the recipient won't know exactly where it came from. Similarly, if you visit a website using a VPN, that website won't know exactly where you are.VPNs are a privacy and security tool that protects you in three key ways according to Haych Li, former vice president at ExpressVPN. One is that VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and data. When this information is unencrypted, anyone in the chain between you and the destination (say, a porn site) can potentially see it. An example is the owner of a WiFi hotspot you use at a coffee shop. With a VPN, however, your traffic can't be seen by that intermediary. Secondly, VPNs encrypt DNS (Domain Name System) requests. Li compared DNS to a phonebook. A DNS request is like looking up a number in the phonebook — you're asking your computer to find something, like a website.The third tactic is that VPNs mask your IP address, which is a unique number connected to your device and linked t"

But it was a big swing and a miss. While Christy does explore the struggles Martin faced in a male-dominated sport, at home with her abusive husband, and as a closeted gay woman, it does so with all the nuance of a a sledgehammer. As I wrote in my pan out of TIFF, \"This movie is a mess, and Sweeney is a contributor to that, not its highlights. For one thing, she uses Martin's West Virginia background as an excuse to slap on a thick Southern accent that comes and goes. For another, while her look is different in Christy, it doesn't read \"athlete,\" as she lacks tone and physicality...[director David] Michôd seems most riveted by the criminal violence than any other aspect of Martin's story. So even what this film has to say about being a woman in sports, or a lesbian in America, or a person at all, is perplexing. In the end, Christy doesn't hit hard. It just blows.\" — Kristy Puchko, Entertainment EditorStarring: Sydney Sweeney, Ben Foster, Merritt Wever, and Katy O'BrianHow to watch: Christy is now available for rent or purchase on Prime Video.Want a showbiz comedy that's about what can happen if your imagination runs away with you? Then, check out The Mother, the Menacer, and Me.

Hollywood dreams are hard enough to attain when you don't have a mean mother-in-law (Lorraine Bracco) scowling over every decision you make. But Eddie has an unlikely ally in the Menacer, a creepy character he's made up who's actively rooting for violent vengeance against those who stand between the man and his moviemaking aspirations.

        "fullContent": "Join Mashable as we look back at the viral videos, breakout movies, memes, dating trends, tech buzz, scientific breakthroughs, and more moments that defined 2025!If you're concerned about scams in 2025, start by monitoring your texts. Many of the most common internet scams of the year start with a text message.Of course, scams are everywhere because the internet has made it so easy for bad actors to do bad things. But, quite notably, the year in scams has largely been defined by text-based scams. You've likely heard about, or even received, these scams: The E-ZPass scam, the DMV scam, and the job offer scam, to name a few. And sadly, romance scams and malware trickery still abound.To keep yourself and your loved ones safe online, here are the most common internet scams you need to be aware of in 2025.The E-ZPass scam texts — or scams involving other similar toll services —  have seemingly been the most prevalent scam in 2025. We here at Mashable initially covered the story in January and updated with readers on the scammers' latest tactics and targets in May. The TL;DR is that scammers send a text falsely claiming you have unpaid tolls, often creating a sense of urgency by threatening to suspend your license or enact some other severe punishment. Oftentimes, the text includes a link and, to be very clear: Do Not Click Any Links (or copy-paste a broken URL into another browser). If you're curious about the scam texts, they typically looking something like the examples embedded below and are often sent from random phone numbers or email addresses. In general, it's best to not engage with scams at all. That means do not click links, do not respond to the text, or do not start a chat on some other messaging service. If you have any concerns about an outstanding toll bill, the Federal Trade Commission recommends contacting your local agency directly. It's worth noting that the tolling agencies will not send a bill via text and will not threaten to suspend your license. If you get a scam E-ZPass text, you should just delete it and report it as junk, which is an option for most phones. Another common scam in 2025 is the DMV text scam. It's effectively a close cousin to the E-ZPass scams described above. The text itself is a near copy-paste from the E-ZPass scam. DMV offices in states like California, Florida, and New York issued warnings that scammers would spam people with texts claiming to be from the DMV, falsely saying the driver had unpaid tickets and their driver's license was in jeopardy. These are fake and should be treated exactly the same as the E-ZPass tolls. There are just so many text-based scams out there. A new one this year centered on Coinbase, the crypto platform. Typically speaking, the scammer reaches out with a phone number or link in an apparent attempt to get your financial information. Though the message often claims some transaction took place, that's fake: You can safely delete it and move on. Very common scam to watch out for."

The clips bear the hallmarks of generative AI video — generic-looking actors, exaggerated movements, strange inconsistencies, and a flat, artless aesthetic.After the video gained mainstream attention, the backlash from AI haters was overwhelming. While the \"most terrible time of the year\" theme may have been intended as tongue-in-cheek, many viewers found the idea cynical. By Dec. 9, McDonald's Netherlands pulled the holiday commercial, or advert.McDonald's provided Mashable with the following statement from McDonald's Netherlands:\"McDonald’s Netherlands has decided to remove our AI-generated Christmas advert. It was intended to reflect the stressful moments that can occur during the holidays in the Netherlands, but we recognize that for many of our guests, the season is 'the most wonderful time of the year'. We respect that and remain committed to creating experiences that offer Good Times and Good Food for everyone.\"Recently, Coca-Cola published its own AI-generated holiday commercial, made in partnership with the AI studio Secret Level. Though Coca-Cola also faced backlash for its ad, the company has continued playing the ad throughout the holiday season, undeterred by critics.The BBC reports that the McDonald's Netherlands commercial was made by the Dutch company TBWA\\Neboko and the U.S. company The Sweetshop. Speaking to Futurism, the CEO of Sweetshop emphasized that a lot of human labor went into the final product.\"We generated what felt like dailies — thousands of takes — then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production,” the CEO reportedly said. \"This wasn’t an AI trick. It was a film.\"But for AI critics, any amount of AI in filmmaking or advertising is unacceptable, full stop.

Yet most B2B marketing teams are still experimenting with just the basics (chatbots or copywriting assistance) without building an AI-native mindset and workflows that unlock real competitive advantage.These webinars— featuring speakers from Demandbase, NetLine, Emerald Studio and Omnibound AI— explored real-time adjustments to stay ahead in a rapidly shifting go-to-market environment, smarter demand generation tactics, the latest Martech trends and how to leverage them for growth.Below are webinars that made up SPS25:Most webinars about “planning” will hand you another template. Another funnel. Another marketing acronym. This is not the webinar Josh Baez of NetLine is offeringIn this session, attendees explored why marketing’s best-laid plans don’t live in frameworks, but in the mushy in-betweens. This webinar isn’t a talk about filling cells in a doc— it’s a call from Baez to reclaim the joy, the chaos, and the spark that make marketing worth doing in the first place.B2B marketing is in the middle of a seismic shift. Teams aren’t struggling because they lack tools, they’re struggling because they can’t connect the dots between data, insights, and impact. The winners of 2026 will be those who start activating the intelligence they already have.Demandbase’s Alicia Hale was joined by The Harris Poll’s Rob Jekielek to detail the lesson that can be learned from Demandbase’s State of B2B Marketing report. Drawing from the perspectives of over 500 senior B2B decision makers, subjects they will explore will include why disconnected data is the silent killer of B2B momentum (and how to fix it) and where alignment between marketing, sales, and ops creates the biggest lift.AI is rewriting the marketing flight manual, opening up a universe of new possibilities for efficiency and personalization. But with every launch comes turbulence: shrinking click-through rates, growing data privacy concerns, and the rise of AI-generated search results are becoming increasingly common hurdles. To stay in orbit, B2B marketers need a content strategy built for this new frontier.Join Emerald Studio’s crew of experts—Pamela Ravetier, Design Director; Tonya Cooper, Senior Content Strategist; and Alexis Carroll Cline, Studio Director— for this dynamic webinar packed with practical strategies, actionable "

        "fullContent": "If you missed our 12th Annual Strategy & Planning Series (SPS), we have now the four sessions on demand to help you plan for 2026 as marketers are faced with creating a new hybrid workplace not based on location, but on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) tools.Titled Decoding the Future of Marketing: B2B and AI Trends for 2026 and Beyond, the series did not feeding prompts into ChatGPT, but posed them to leading B2B marketing experts—sparking real conversations, fresh perspectives, and actionable insights that you can use to fuel your team’s B2B marketing success.AI is completely reshaping the way B2B marketers understand customers, design workflows, and drive growth. Yet most B2B marketing teams are still experimenting with just the basics (chatbots or copywriting assistance) without building an AI-native mindset and workflows that unlock real competitive advantage.These webinars— featuring speakers from Demandbase, NetLine, Emerald Studio and Omnibound AI— explored real-time adjustments to stay ahead in a rapidly shifting go-to-market environment, smarter demand generation tactics, the latest Martech trends and how to leverage them for growth.Below are webinars that made up SPS25:Most webinars about “planning” will hand you another template. Another funnel. Another marketing acronym. This is not the webinar Josh Baez of NetLine is offeringIn this session, attendees explored why marketing’s best-laid plans don’t live in frameworks, but in the mushy in-betweens. This webinar isn’t a talk about filling cells in a doc— it’s a call from Baez to reclaim the joy, the chaos, and the spark that make marketing worth doing in the first place.B2B marketing is in the middle of a seismic shift. Teams aren’t struggling because they lack tools, they’re struggling because they can’t connect the dots between data, insights, and impact. The winners of 2026 will be those who start activating the intelligence they already have.Demandbase’s Alicia Hale was joined by The Harris Poll’s Rob Jekielek to detail the lesson that can be learned from Demandbase’s State of B2B Marketing report. Drawing from the perspectives of over 500 senior B2B decision makers, subjects they will explore will include why disconnected data is the silent killer of B2B momentum (and how to fix it) and where alignment between marketing, sales, and ops creates the biggest lift.AI is rewriting the marketing flight manual, opening up a universe of new possibilities for efficiency and personalization. But with every launch comes turbulence: shrinking click-through rates, growing data privacy concerns, and the rise of AI-generated search results are becoming increasingly common hurdles. To stay in orbit, B2B marketers need a content strategy built for this new frontier.Join Emerald Studio’s crew of experts—Pamela Ravetier, Design Director; Tonya Cooper, Senior Content Strategist; and Alexis Carroll Cline, Studio Director— for this dynamic webinar packed with practical strategies, actionable "

The team at TopRank Marketing and our research partner Ascend2 are happy to announce the release of a new research report. Answer Engine: The State of B2B Thought Leadership in 2026.Get the PDF version of the report here.B2B marketers are feeling the pressure to perform during a time of uncertainty and AI-powered disruption. Thought leadership has risen as a key strategy for brands to differentiate, create trust and fuel an engine of full funnel content across traditional search and social media, generative search and industry media.While the notion of thought leadership is familiar to most B2B marketers, many view the discipline through a limited lens without clarity around tactics or measurement.Why did we undertake new research into thought leadership? We’ve worked with our research partner Ascend2 on numerous original research projects for clients over the years.  Our B2B marketing agency has itself published reports, blog posts, videos and articles, engaged in media interviews and presented at marketing conferences in multiple markets in North America and Western Europe based on insights from our own original research.We’ve seen firsthand the difference in performance between status quo research reports and what we call “best answer” content. There’s a notable difference between content that involves influencers vs. not, and when that content is dynamic and experiential vs. when it is not. We’ve also seen what happens when thought leadership visibility is limited to brand channels and ads vs. being visible everywhere the audience can be influenced. Last, we have seen the challenges many B2B brands experience trying to pull together disparate data sources to effectively measure multi-channel thought leadership content.Top performers’ use of thought leadership as an engine of content have been particularly effective during times of uncertainty as competition for attention increases and interest in the most trustworthy sources and solutions accelerates.Most B2B marketers have seen firsthand the growing importance of thought leadership for credibility with LLMs and Google as well as with industry media, influencers and B2B audiences. To better understand that importance, we partnered with Ascend2 to further investigate the intersection of how B2B marketers are using original research to fuel their thought leadership and the intersection with influence and content.We surveyed just under 800 B2B marketers in the U.S. and U.K. where 81% were in senior marketing leadership roles. B2B industries represented include technology and software, manufacturing, professional services, financial services, construction and real estate, healthcare and marketing / advertising. We discovered that the value and perception of thought leadership is very high and yet significant gaps exist between top performers and all others.97% of B2B market"

From AI Overviews on Google to many of the business applications we use every day, AI is changing how business information is discovered, consumed and acted on in ways that few could have imagined just a few years ago.With the rise of AI tools and content, B2B marketers face an interesting paradox: trust is harder to earn, but more important than ever. Buyers are tuning out generic brand and AI-generated content and tuning in to the voices they trust, that speak their language, share their challenges, and tell stories they can relate to.This is where influencer marketing is playing an increasingly important role for B2B companies to humanize the brand by working with influencers, to inspire creativity, and drive more meaningful vs. mechanical engagement. With engagement comes connection and the trust needed to take action.So what does an action-inspiring B2B marketing influencer campaign look like? From Lenovo’s late-night tech talk show to Sprinklr’s “Socialverse” masterclass and LinkedIn’s #MyMarketingStory initiative, each of these programs leaned into storytelling vs. selling. These campaigns also share a simple truth: influence in B2B is about connection. It’s also about making complex ideas relatable and human. And when done right, influencer marketing for B2B can win the hearts and minds of your customers as well as drive business results.\nApproach: Lenovo created Late Night I.T., a first-of-its-kind, after-hours “tech talk show” web series hosted by futurist and comedian Baratunde Thurston. The show featured 8 episodes with tech industry leaders as guests that turned complex IT topics into entertaining, easily understood conversations. Lenovo promoted the series across paid, owned, and earned social channels to engage IT decision-makers in a fresh, humorous way.Results: The campaign outperformed benchmarks significantly, generating 300 million impressions (70% above industry norm) and 72 million video views (11× the benchmark). It also lifted brand consideration by 7 points and attracted interest from “thousands of large enterprises.” The series became so popular that a major TV network picked it up for a summer broadcast.\nApproach: Customer experience platform Sprinklr teamed with TopRank Marketing to launch “Across the Socialverse,” a documentary-style masterclass event hosted by respected social media thought leaders​. Influencers like Ann Handley, Jay Baer, Mari Smith and senior executives from Sprinklr were featured in live and video sessions demonstrating Sprinklr’s new AI-integrated Social Self-Serve product. The fully integrated campaign included a virtual event on Social Media Day, influencer-led video content, blogs, email, and extensive social amplification by the influencers, Sprinklr, and even partner organizations.Results: The Socialverse campaign was a “resounding success” globally – it attracted over"

In-house content marketing teams have their hands full right now. Like all areas of marketing, they’re contending with constrained budgets and rising expectations. As with professionals of any stripe, they’re trying to navigate the AI revolution opportunistically yet responsibly. Meanwhile, the content discovery landscape is being flipped upside down.These challenges aren’t unique, but as a function focused on creative production, content tends to feel the brunt of them. The struggle is real: Canto’s State of Digital Content 2025 survey found that only 19% of teams managed to increase content ROI last year.Breaking through with standout results in this moment requires an edge. Marketing agencies specializing in content strategy, planning and creation can provide just that. But like any investment, hiring an agency needs to be scrutinized. You need to be confident in the firm you’re choosing, and that — as an external partner — they will be able to plug in seamlessly, helping your efforts rather than hindering them or slowing you down.At TopRank Marketing, we’ve got plenty of experience joining forces with content teams from companies big and small. And we’ve proven we can help these teams take their game to the next level — our longtime clients at LinkedIn Ads, for example, were named Best In-House/Brand Team by The Drum Awards.We know what it takes to build and sustain an agency-client engagement that delivers real value and impact for content marketing teams. These are the essential mainstays of a successful partnership.In the latest enterprise content marketing benchmark research from CMI and MarketingProfs, these three challenges topped the list for content creation teams:As it happens, these are three specific areas where agency partners can be most impactful!Communicating across organizational silos.This is a persistent point of friction in larger organizations, and it’s not hard to see why: different teams have their own focuses, and often their own disconnected goals to meet. However, lack of communication and cohesion across the organization often leads to inefficiency at best and counterproductivity at worst.Agency partners that are accustomed to navigating enterprise dynamics as outsiders can be very helpful in spotting silos and uncovering opportunities for greater alignment. At TopRank, we often integrate directly with different business units in the same company (e.g. content and product, or content and IT) to help foster effective collaboration and coordination.Lack of resources.The advantage of working with an agency amid a resource crunch speaks for itself, providing your team with access to seasoned cross-functional talent so you can get things done on time without sacrificing quality or strategic oversight. Partnering with an agency opens your business up to a world of new resources, which can be vital if"

The Last of Us Season 2 is already underway on HBO and 28 Years Later is dropping in theaters this June, reminding us just how quickly the world can turn on its head, and how only the resourceful survive.Sound familiar, marketers?Welcome to the post-apocalyptic reality of search. Once a fertile land of clicks and traffic, today’s SEO landscape has been overrun by AI-generated answers, zero-click SERPs, and a search experience seemingly designed to keep users from ever reaching your site. It’s brutal. It’s unpredictable. And it’s happening right now.Brands and marketers face a daunting ultimatum: adapt or perish.This guide is your SEO backpack: packed with strategies, tools, and frameworks to help you navigate the new terrain, reclaim visibility, and keep your content alive in a world where clicks are scarce and competition is fierce. Ready to make the journey? Let’s go.Not so long ago, most of us had never heard the phrase “zero-click search.” Today it describes nearly 60% of all Google queries. This scourge has been spreading like a zombie outbreak, and causing equal amounts of terror in the marketing community. Businesses have long relied on organic search as a mainstay for web visibility, accounting for 76% of trackable traffic to B2B websites as of about five years ago, per BrightEdge.Zero-click searches, referring to those where a user gets their answer directly on the search results page without needing to click any links, are becoming more prevalent for several different reasons:Okay, so we know the root causes. The question, of course, is what you should do about it. At TopRank Marketing our team has been heavily focused on helping clients navigate SERP volatility and thrive in the new era of search. We see all these trends first-hand and we’ve been hard at work collaborating on solutions. Use this survival toolkit to find your way.“AI has completely shifted the landscape and we’re currently living through a time where it’s impossible to predict what search market share will look like. Even if Google keeps their top spot, the way they deliver answers to queries will never be the same. The days of being one of ten blue links on a page are over.” – Steve Slater, Sr. Manager, SEO and SEM at HealthPartners in our blog post SEO Trends & Predictions for 2025When the rules change overnight, the smart ones don’t panic. They plan.In a world where AI Overviews push organic listings further down the page and zero-click searches claim more territory each month, it’s tempting to question the value of SEO altogether. But make no mistake: the fundamentals haven’t fallen — they’ve simply evolved.Search engine optimization remains one of the most powerful long-term tools in a marketer’s survival kit. Organic visibility still drives some of the most qualified traffic, and in an age where paid media "

Research from TopRank and Ascend2 found that 93% of B2B marketers say research-backed content drives engagement and leads, yet only a fraction invest enough to differentiate. At the same time, 72% of marketers who frequently collaborate with trusted industry influencers report their thought leadership content is very effective, compared to just 29% of everyone else.While B2B marketing is transforming and 56% of B2B organizations planning to increase agency spending, one thing is clear: the agency you choose can no longer simply be an execution partner. They need to bring the perspective of a strategic marketing partner. The right agency can help B2B marketers create greater certainty, build trust, and create systems that perform even as the landscape of how companies find, engage and source solutions transforms.To help B2B companies navigate finding the right strategic marketing partner, this post is a guide for evaluating what to look for in a B2B marketing agency that provide a strategic perspective as well as a guide for implementation.B2B marketers today face an overabundance of data but a shortage of insight. The most effective agencies go beyond reporting metrics to interpret patterns, ask better questions, and uncover the buyer signals that drive meaningful decisions.In our 2026 B2B Thought Leadership research, top performing B2B marketers were far more likely to:A B2B marketing agency worth your trust practices data-informed clarity, going beyond dashboards to provide marketing intelligence that can shape narratives, content, and channel decisions from the start.Ask potential agency partners:\n“How do you determine what buyers actually need to know and how do you validate it?”The best partners will have a disciplined methodology.The most common failure pattern in B2B marketing today is fragmentation where marketing functions operate independently, creating tactical outputs that never add up to strategic outcomes.Our own research shows this clearly: One-third of marketers cite over-reliance on a few channels as a barrier to full-funnel performance, and another third report limited visibility across the funnel.A strong B2B marketing agency partner will approach brand, demand, content, and visibility as one connec"

In September 2025, annual global inflation, as measured by the 12-month change rate in consumer prices across all economies, stood at 3.6 percent, in line with inflation recorded in August and July 2025. Global inflation peaked at 9.6 percent in September 2022 and had been declining since. This levelling off is experienced by both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging and developing economies (EMDEs). In AEs, inflation has been steady around 2.5 percent over several months and slightly increased in September to 2.7 percent (2.8 percent for G7 economies). In EMDEs, disinflation started later than in AEs. This decoupling subsided after mid-2024, and inflation in EMDEs has now stabilized, albeit at a higher level-3.9 percent in September.Across regions, a similar leveling off of the disinflationary trend is notable, with inflation either stable compared to recent months (Europe) or picking up modestly in Asia (3.0 percent), Oceania (3.1 percent) and the Americas (3.6 percent). Only Africa continued to experience a substantial reduction in inflation, from a higher level, down to 7.6 percent. Despite clear regional trends, country specific differences persist.  \nNotes: The inflation estimates are published approximately 2 months after the reference period. Our release includes September 2025 data, before the October 2025 US shutdown. The aggregated annual inflation is calculated using a geometrically weighted average of officially disseminated indexes, with annual PPP-adjusted GDP lagged by one year as weights. Coverage includes 165 economies worldwide, 46 in Africa, 33 in the Americas, 39 in Asia, 41 in Europe and 6 in Oceania. All aggregates are benchmarked to the WEO annual rates for 2024 and prior years, except for regional and G20 estimates since WEO does not produce those.EXPLORE THIS DATASEGlobal Debt Database for 2024 was released on December 2, 2025.

        "fullContent": "The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists.October 2025The global economy is adjusting to a landscape reshaped by new policy measures. Some extremes of higher tariffs were tempered, thanks to subsequent deals and resets. But the overall environment remains volatile, and temporary factors that supported activity in the first half of 2025—such as front-loading—are fading.\nAs a result, global growth projections in the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) are revised upward relative to the April 2025 WEO but continue to mark a downward revision relative to the pre-policy-shift forecasts. Global growth is projected to slow from 3.3 percent in 2024 to 3.2 percent in 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, with advanced economies growing around 1.5 percent and emerging market and developing economies just above 4 percent. Inflation is projected to continue to decline globally, though with variation across countries: above target in the United States—with risks tilted to the upside—and subdued elsewhere.\nRisks are tilted to the downside. Prolonged uncertainty, more protectionism, and labor supply shocks could reduce growth. Fiscal vulnerabilities, potential financial market corrections, and erosion of institutions could threaten stability.\nPolicymakers are urged to restore confidence through credible, transparent, and sustainable policies. Trade diplomacy should be paired with macroeconomic adjustment. Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt. Central bank independence should be preserved. Efforts on structural reforms should be redoubled. As Chapter 2 shows, past actions to improve policy frameworks have served countries well. As Chapter 3 demonstrates, industrial policy may have a role, but full consideration should be given to opportunity costs and trade-offs involved in its use.Data assumptions, conventions, and classificationsKey Global Economic IndicatorsSupplemental Global Economic IndicatorsOctober 2025 DatabaseFAQ on the October 2025 ReleaseSend Us your QuestionsAccess the Datamapper Subscribe to RSSOctober 14, 20252:43October 14, 202545:45October 13, 20252:21October 6, 20251:29:37October 3, 20251:00:54October 14, 20252:43October 14, 202545:45October 13, 20252:21October 6, 20251:29:37October 3, 20251:00:54October 14, 20252:43October 14, 202545:45October 13, 20252:21October 6, 20251:29:37October 3, 20251:00:54World Economic OutlookGlobal Financial Stability ReportFiscal MonitorJuly 2025Regional Economic OutlooksSeptember 2025Finance & Development\n\n© 2025 International Monetary Fund.

        "fullContent": "Credit: James Mertz/IMF Photo The cornerstones of our digital world—from smartphone apps to new digital assets and artificial intelligence tools—didn’t exist back in 2008, the last time the world’s statistical community overhauled its approach to standardizing how countries measure the economy.Now, an updated System of National Accounts—the global standard for producing measures of economic activity—more fully incorporates emerging technologies, digital services, and intangible assets. Remarkably, despite increasing geoeconomic fragmentation, the United Nations Statistical Commission in March unanimously approved the wide-ranging and comprehensive update. It’s the sixth iteration in the almost nine-decade history of the SNA, a global standard for national metrics including production, income, consumption, capital investment and financial activities, as well as national wealth. Updating the SNA is a global effort coordinated by the International Monetary Fund, United Nations, World Bank, European Commission, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.The IMF contributed significantly to the SNA update in areas such as digitalization, trade, government finances, and financial innovation. These contributions help ensure that governments have the tools to make more informed decisions about how to grow their economies, create jobs, and respond to shocks. Accurate economic statistics are vital for effective policymaking. And measurement across the $114 trillion global economy must keep up even as the pace of change accelerates. If it doesn’t keep pace, central banks and finance ministries will end up setting monetary or fiscal policy based on incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate information.This is why the revised SNA focuses on digitalization. For example, despite rapid advances in digital technologies, reported productivity growth in many advanced economies has remained sluggish. That has led some researchers to suggest that this could partly reflect gaps in how digital activity was measured.Another important driver of the SNA update is the growing importance of crypto assets, which was among the most challenging to address. Bitcoin, for example, has a tangible economic impact, including because it consumes large amounts of energy to produce. Yet because it doesn’t involve the creation of goods or services in the traditional sense, it isn’t counted in gross domestic product.Measuring crypto is crucial from a public policy perspective because, while it may account for a relatively small share of global assets, it could have significant implications for future financial stability, tax policy, and regulatory oversight. Now, statisticians have found a way to classify certain crypto assets as “non-produced nonfinancial assets,” which are reflected in national wealth. Ensuring that the new SNA can guide countries on how to report crypto is one way to future-proof standards.Crypto, of course, is only one consideration among many for digital t"

The Forum is a platform for policymakers, researchers, the private sector, regulators, and compilers of economic and financial data to come together to discuss cutting edge issues in macroeconomic and financial statistics and to build support for statistical improvements.The theme of this year’s Statistical Forum is Measuring Cross-border Economic and Financial Linkages in a Dynamic World. The ongoing changes in the global economy emanating from globalization, digitalization, and innovations in financial markets and instruments are becoming more complex. Accurate measurement of these international interactions is needed to assist policymakers, macroeconomists, and businesses in making informed decisions at the time of increased uncertainty. The 13th Statistical Forum will explore how the recently updated International Statistical Standards, the Integrated Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual, seventh edition (BPM7) and System of National Accounts 2025 Manua (SNA2025), can help address some of the current measurement gaps and explore any new, emerging gaps that may need to be addressed by the statistical community.13th IMF Statistical Forum Registration ▶WEDNESDAY, November 19, 20258:30-9:00amRegistration9:00-9:05amWelcoming RemarksKristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, IMF9:05-9:15amIntroduction to the ForumBert Kroese, Chief Statistician and Data Officer, and Director of IMF Statistics Department9:15-10:00amSession I: Opening AddressKeynote Speech: Simon Johnson, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of ManagementOne-on-one Discussion: Nigel Clarke, Deputy Managing Director, IMFSimon Johnson, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management10:00-10:30amCoffee Break10:30am-12:00pmSession II: Who is Making What with Whom?

This new edition provides updated global standards for compiling external sector statistics, including balance of payments and integrated international investment position. It highlights key changes in the global economy, such as the increasing economic interconnectedness, digitalization, and innovations in financial markets since the time of the last update of the manual in 2009.The launch of BPM7 marks the culmination of several years of work by the IMF Statistics Department in consultation with the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics (BOPCOM), with support from the global balance of payments (BOP) community of statisticians and users. BPM7 serves as a key framework for member countries, guiding the preparation of internationally comparable statistics and the production of high-quality data that reflects economic realities.The release of BPM7 coincides with the release of the updated System of National Accounts, 2025 (2025 SNA) which was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission on March 5, 2025 (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2025.asp). The Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 and Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide 2016 will also be revised in the near term to maintain their harmonization with the two updated standards. This uniform set of statistical methodologies ensures policymakers can make well-informed, data-driven decisions.Countries are encouraged to implement both standards by 2029–2030. The IMF will support implementation of the updated BPM7 by providing additional guidance and technical assistance.The white cover (pre-edited) version of BPM7 is available electronically in English, with publication in other languages—Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish—expected to be completed following the release of the final version.PRESS OFFICER: Rahim KananiPhone: +1 202 623-7100Email: MEDIA@IMF.org\n @IMFSpokesperson © 2025 International Monetary Fund.

Creators were amazed. Cultural critics were uneasy. And marketers? They found themselves somewhere in the middle. Both fascinated by the creative possibilities, yet uncertain about what it all means for their brands, budgets, and workflows.While much of the conversation has centered on what AI can create from scratch, there's another side of this story that's just as transformative and, for most marketing teams, a lot more actionable right now.Because AI isn't just changing what video can look like. It's also revolutionizing how marketers produce and use authentic, human-led video.Tools like Sora and Vibes showcase the awe-inspiring potential of AI-generated content. They stretch our imagination and redefine what's possible.But just beyond that frontier, another revolution is unfolding—one that uses AI to enhance the real, human stories brands are already telling.AI is making every step of the real-world video lifecycle faster, smarter, and more efficient. It's helping marketing teams:This is AI working with human creativity, not replacing it. AI is amplifying authenticity—the quality audiences are craving most right now.Generative video models like Sora and Runway also point to a profound shift in how the \"craft\" of video production itself may evolve.Today, one of the biggest bottlenecks in creating professional-grade marketing video isn't shooting footage. Animation, motion graphics, and visual effects make content feel polished, but they are highly skilled, time-consuming disciplines most marketers can't touch without an external agency or design team, creating bottlenecks.AI video tools are beginning to change that. They can synthesize motion graphics, create backgrounds, or even animate static visuals. This dramatically reduces both cost and turnaround time.In other words, the same technology that can generate fully synthetic videos could soon augment and accelerate the production of \"real\" ones, giving marketers access to animation-level quality without the traditional bottlenecks.Herein lies the bridge between the synthetic and the authentic: using generative AI to eliminate friction in professional production so human storytelling can move faster and look better than ever.If AI-generated video showcases AI's imaginative potential, real video demonstrates its connective power. Together, they reveal the full spectrum of what AI can enable.In a landscape where digital experiences can be manufactured in seconds, authenticity becomes one of a brand's most valuable assets. People still want to see and hear from real experts, real customers, and real leaders, and AI can make it exponentially easier for those voices to be seen and heard.While platforms like Sor"

That statistic should stop digital experience leaders in their tracks. By the time people land on your website, they're already conditioned to expect instant answers. They're not in the mood to dig through menus or hunt for links. They want to ask a question and get a clear, intuitive, and trustworthy response.Which raises an uncomfortable truth: Your search bar may be the single most important experience on your site.Generative AI, answer engines, and search overviews are transforming the way people approach information. The rules of digital discovery are no longer fixed. In this new environment, the organizations that focus only on external optimization are missing half the equation.Once users land on your site, the expectations set by AI-powered search tools follow them. If your onsite search cannot keep pace—if it fails to deliver relevant results, understand intent, or provide meaningful guidance—users will bounce back to Google or their LLM search tool. They may not come back.Imagine a procurement manager at a midsize manufacturer who asks an LLM-powered search engine, \"What's the best software for supply chain risk management?\" The AI summary pulls in market comparisons, analyst quotes, and a shortlist of vendors.When that manager clicks through to one of those vendor sites, expectations are already set: They want to type a question into the site's search bar such as \"integrations with SAP,\" \"pricing for mid-market,\" or \"implementation timeline\" and get precise, reliable answers. If the site search fails, the impression is not just of poor navigation but of a company unprepared to meet enterprise needs.For B2B organizations, the stakes are higher because every search interaction reflects brand trust and readiness.That is why onsite search can no longer be treated as a backend utility. It's become a frontline contributor to engagement, conversion, and customer satisfaction.And the most important distinction: Onsite search is the one layer brands fully control.You own the content. You shape the experience. You decide how results are presented, how keywords and questions are interpreted, and how quickly answers are delivered. Unlike external search platforms that shift algorithms without warning, your search experience is your domain.That level of control is rare in this ne"

It's labeled something like \"2024 Webinars\" or \"Event Recordings.\"Inside are dozens of recordings: product demos, customer panels, thought leadership webinars, virtual summit sessions. Hours of content featuring your best experts and customers. And it's all just sitting there.Here's what most B2B marketing teams don't realize: your video library isn't an archive. It's inventory. And right now, you're sitting on unused inventory that could fill your content calendar, feed your sales team, and generate leads for the next six months.According to Wyzowl's State of Video Marketing 2024, some 91% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, but only 39% have a documented strategy for repurposing that content. That gap? That's your opportunity.You don't need to create more content. You need to extract more value from what you already have.And it takes 15 minutes to figure out where that value is hiding.Think about what it takes to produce a single webinar: weeks of planning, speaker coordination, deck building, and promotion. That one hour of video cost you thousands of dollars and hundreds of work hours. Yet most teams use it once, maybe twice.But that webinar—and every other video in your library—contains dozens of reusable assets: product demos for sales, customer testimonials for social proof, expert insights for blog posts, problem-solution moments for ads, and data points for thought leadership.The content is already there. The speakers already said it. You just  need a system to find and package it.Here's how to quickly identify which videos in your library have the most untapped potential.Set a timer. Open your video archive. Let's find your hidden revenue.Pull up whatever analytics you have—Zoom, your video platform, YouTube—wherever your recordings live.Look for these three signals.Videos that score high on all three? Those are your tier-1 assets. Flag them.Any video featuring a customer is immediately more valuable than one without.Why? Because third-party validation sells better than anything you can say about yourself.Scroll through your recordings and flag anything with:Even a 30-second customer quote can become a social post, email signature, or sales asset.Some content has a shelf life. Product updates from two years ago? Probably outdated. Industry predictions for 2023? Not relevant anymore.But some content is evergreen:Flag your evergreen content. These pieces can be repurposed indefinitely and will keep generating value for years.This is where you find the real gold: great moments from videos you've barely promoted.Skim through a few recordings and look for the following.These moments are clip-worthy LinkedIn posts, email hooks, and future content starters.

However, most businesses are still struggling to successfully turn their AI expectations into reality.A mere 25% of CEOs say their AI initiatives have delivered their anticipated ROI.Although larger companies often have the time and resources needed to experiment with this technology, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that are forced to navigate tighter budgets don't have the financial resources to wait for impact. The lack of ROI is extremely costly to their bottom line.SMBs need to see tangible results that can help justify their investments. In short, their AI strategies must take an approach that enables them to drive more near-term results for their business.So how can SMBs turn AI investments into real impact?At a time when business growth is becoming increasingly reliant on  customer experience (CX), with 78% of consumers saying a bad customer experience would cause them to switch from using a business, SMB marketers are in a prime position to help their businesses reap the benefits of AI.Marketers are the driving force behind the initial interactions that leads have with their brand, and in today's CX-centric world, those first impressions are everything. Especially when people are willing to move their business elsewhere when their expectations aren't met.Enhanced customer experiences now play a critical role not just in converting leads into customers for SMBs but also in their overall growth as well. That CX demand offers SMB marketers a unique opportunity to make AI investments that'll drive actual, and immediate, results for their business.Considering the explosion of AI tools available to businesses, finding the right solution can be a major obstacle—in fact, nearly half (48%) of small businesses using AI are struggling to choose the right tools.Because SMB marketers require solutions that can drive actual results while enabling them to deliver enhanced CX interactions, they should be prioritizing investments in voice AI, which is able to process and generate human-like speech.Instead of a generic robotic voice that's limited in responses, voice AI solutions provide customers with human-like interactions with the ability to recognize and adapt responses based on everything from tone to caller needs.Voice AI capabilities take traditional interactions to the next level. Powered with the right voice AI tool, SMB marketers can achieve three strategic objectives.Because of resource restraints, SMBs often have smaller teams tasked with wearing many hats. Therefore, as calls come in, they may well be occupied with other high-priority tasks, resulting in calls that go unanswered.For SMBs, each call is an opportunity, and missed calls result in missed revenue.Voice AI solutions equip SMBs with the ability to ensure every call to their business gets is picked up, even when the business is c"

You may have seen it reflected in decreasing organic traffic to your website.These days, your customers aren't always starting their research with Google. They're now asking questions on ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude and relying on zero-click searches.As for what feeds these AI search results, here's what's really interesting: AI-driven search systems love well-written press releases.That's right; the format that's been around for decades is now the content type AI trusts the most.Let's unpack why and explain how you can use this to your advantage.For years, SEO only involved keywords, backlinks, and meta tags. But now, people are searching differently.When someone types latest cybersecurity solutions for healthcare into Gemini or which manufacturer announced new sustainability goals in 2025 into ChatGPT, these tools don't just look at blogs.AI tools look for factual, structured, and trusted content—the type of information they can confidently summarize and cite.That's where press releases come in.A 2025 Bond Capital report on AI trends notes that generative AI tools are rapidly shifting toward \"retrieval-based generation,\" which means they pull information from verified, structured sources—not random websites.And few formats check these boxes better than a press release.AI models are very smart, albeit picky, readers. They love structure, authority, and clarity.Here's how press releases deliver all three.And according to the 2025 Bond Capital report, tools like Gemini and ChatGPT now use vector-based ranking systems that prioritize content with metadata, timestamps, and verified sources—key elements of a properly formatted press release.Let's look at how this plays out in the real world across some of the biggest B2B sectors.Across every industry, the same rule applies: the clearer, more structured, and better-sourced your announcement, the more likely it is to surface and stay visible in AI-powered discovery.If you want your next announcement to show up in AI results, not just on news sites, start here.As a B2B marketer, you're no longer just writing for people; you're writing for algorithms that serve people.Your next press release could be the answer AI gives to questions like:And when your brand is the answer, you win visibility that lasts far beyond your launch day.This shift doesn't make marketing and public relations less human; it makes them more strategic.The world of discovery has changed, and your press releases can lead the way. When your news is structured, factual, and published through trusted channels, you're giving AI exactly what it's looking for.Because at the end of the day, LLMs don't love press releases because they're traditional; LLMs love press releases because they're trustworthy.And in an age where trust drives visibility, that's a powerful advantage.Enter your ema"

Today I want to talk to you about AI Overviews, which is probably not a new topic, or I hope it's not a new topic to you by now.

So what do I mean by that?So what I'm really talking about is some data that we've started to see over the course of 2025, particularly in the second half of 2025, where it's getting more and more common to see SERPs like this one. So this is just an example. As you can see, it doesn't even have real words on it. But basically, you can see these situations where you might have an organic result and then an organic result and then an AI Overview. Or sometimes it will be an image pack. Or sometimes it will be a featured snippet. Or sometimes it will be discussions and forums. But in any case, you have an AI Overview that isn't in position one. And this never used to happen or pretty much never used to happen historically. So it's interesting that this is a trend that we've started to see.So here's how the data looks at the time of writing.

I'm going to be sharing pretty much everything that I have learned over the course of my career in one video, and hopefully you'll be able to take this and apply it to your business so you can unlock the opportunities that have actually never been possible until the beautiful robots of AI showed up. So let's jump into it. All right, so navigating this new age of content, navigating this new age of search starts with a realization that all of us have to make. And that realization is that as search marketers, we have to understand that there has been a significant shift that has taken place across all of humanity. People don't just search in Google anymore, shout to Bing, and all of those guys, and Ask Jeeves, and all of the other search engines who have been around for years fighting the good fight for search. But now search has become more fragmented.Search is no longer just on Google. Search is now happening on TikTok, it's happening in Reddit,"

It’s about real business impact. Connect rankings to revenue, prove ROI, and show how SEO drives growth.We’ve all been there. You spend weeks optimizing content, fixing technical issues, and building quality links – only to have your client skim through your report and ask, “But how is this affecting our bottom line?”And they’re right to ask. As experienced SEO managers, we need to move beyond traffic numbers and keyword rankings.Your clients don’t care about impressions or even clicks if they can’t see how those metrics translate to actual business results.I’ve learned this lesson the hard way. After losing a major client despite significantly improving their rankings (it turns out they weren’t ranking for terms that actually drove revenue), I completely revamped our reporting approach.Now, I focus on connecting every SEO effort to business outcomes that my clients genuinely care about: revenue growth, reduced acquisition costs, and competitive advantages.The truth is, with AI reshaping search and budgets under constant scrutiny, proving SEO’s business value isn’t optional anymore. It’s essential for keeping your clients and justifying your fees.So, let’s talk about how to transform standard SEO reports into strategic assets that make your clients see you as indispensable.Let’s be real: Your clients aren’t getting bonuses for traffic increases alone anymore.Yes, traffic is still foundational, but your CMO clients are being hammered about return on investment (ROI) in every meeting.They need ammunition to defend their budgets, and “we got more visitors” doesn’t cut it in the boardroom.When I start client reports now, I immediately connect traffic to dollars.Here’s how to transform this section from a traffic report to a value demonstration: First, ditch the habit of leading with “traffic went up X%.”Instead, start with: “Organic search generated $X in revenue this quarter through Y new customers.” This immediately frames SEO as a revenue channel, not a vanity metrics game.Here’s what your traffic section should include:My favorite Google Analytics 4 report for thi"

But they aren’t sure if their own teams can tie social to those outcomes. Which puts social marketers under increased pressure to prove the ROI of their strategy if they want to gain leadership’s trust.We surveyed over 1,200 marketing leaders from around the globe to find out what separates teams who can prove the impact of social from those who can’t. We examined what social marketers can do to make sure their reporting infrastructure prioritizes the right metrics, and how social data can provide value company-wide.Marketing leaders say they want social teams to share competitor and audience insights, data comparing their own performance against innovative brands, and intel into the latest network updates.Marketing leaders and social managers are divided on whether they need to be posting more. Rather than play a volume game, teams should prioritize quality content that speaks to audience truths.Leaders say they want teams outside of digital marketing to use social insights to drive their decisions. For that to happen, teams need stronger integrations and more collaborative rituals.Sprout Social helps you understand and reach your audience, engage your community and measure performance with the only all-in-one"

If you use the right words, your CTA will inspire your audience to take action — click on your ad, download your ebook, add an item to cart… you name it.

They can help you add context to your creatives, build relationships through meaningful storytelling, and even expand your reach. Keep reading to learn how to write the perfect Instagram caption. We’ve even included templates for different kinds of captions that will keep your audience engaged.On Instagram, a caption is the text description you add to your photo or video posts and Reels.Instagram captions can be up to 2,200 characters, and they can include text, hashtags, and emojis. Note that clickable links cannot be added to Instagram captions.Sometimes we all need a little inspiration. If you want to scale your content creation quickly, we’ve compiled a list of 63 sure-fire Instagram captions. You can use these captions on their own (like simply using “Sweater weather” with an emoji) or expanding on it as you see fit (“Sweater weather is the best kind of weather.”) Either way, these captions are a great place to start. You’ve got 63 easy, broad-appeal Instagram captions listed above that can be adapted for so many different purposes. But what about when you want to write your own captions?Whether you’re incorporating any of the ideas from above into your caption or you want to start from scratch, the following tips will all help you write stronger Instagram captions to increase engagement, build relationships and drive sales.Instagram is full of content, which means your visuals and your captions need to be great to grab a user’s attention while they’re scrolling their feed. “Thumb-stopping” is what we’re going for.A big part of starting strong is placing your value proposition (if applicable) in the very beginning of your caption to grasp your audience’s attention. Doing so will help get them to click “read more” and take the next steps outlined in your CTA (call to action). Finding the right value prop and CTA comes down to knowing your audience and what they’ll respond to.Here’s an example. This brand starts the caption off with “Some of our favorite cozy fall recipes also happen to be the simplest.” Since around this time of the year (November), every home cook’s feed is full of elaborate turkey and pie recipes that take hours to make, this is appealing; an easy dinner that’s perfect for the season? Who doesn’t love a simple recipe that can feed their family?<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75213\" src=\"https://adespresso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-9.59.36-AM.png\" alt=\"instagram caption with a strong start \" width=\"662\" height=\"690"

We’ve even included templates for different kinds of captions that will keep your audience engaged.On Instagram, a caption is the text description you add to your photo or video posts and Reels.Instagram captions can be up to 2,200 characters, and they can include text, hashtags, and emojis. Note that clickable links cannot be added to Instagram captions.Sometimes we all need a little inspiration. If you want to scale your content creation quickly, we’ve compiled a list of 63 sure-fire Instagram captions. You can use these captions on their own (like simply using “Sweater weather” with an emoji) or expanding on it as you see fit (“Sweater weather is the best kind of weather.”) Either way, these captions are a great place to start. You’ve got 63 easy, broad-appeal Instagram captions listed above that can be adapted for so many different purposes. But what about when you want to write your own captions?Whether you’re incorporating any of the ideas from above into your caption or you want to start from scratch, the following tips will all help you write stronger Instagram captions to increase engagement, build relationships and drive sales.Instagram is full of content, which means your visuals and your captions need to be great to grab a user’s attention while they’re scrolling their feed. “Thumb-stopping” is what we’re going for.A big part of starting strong is placing your value proposition (if applicable) in the very beginning of your caption to grasp your audience’s attention. Doing so will help get them to click “read more” and take the next steps outlined in your CTA (call to action). Finding the right value prop and CTA comes down to knowing your audience and what they’ll respond to.Here’s an example. This brand starts the caption off with “Some of our favorite cozy fall recipes also happen to be the simplest.” Since around this time of the year (November), every home cook’s feed is full of elaborate turkey and pie recipes that take hours to make, this is appealing; an easy dinner that’s perfect for the season? Who doesn’t love a simple recipe that can feed their family?<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75213\" src=\"https://adespresso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-9.59.36-AM.png\" alt=\"instagram caption with a strong start \" width=\"662\" height=\"690"

This answer is going to be drastically different depending on the size of the business, but in general, you need to have better content and lead with personalization whenever possible. The more I sound like one of the many you’re talking to, the more I’m gonna ignore you as one of the many I don’t care about. With AI and emerging tech, it’s easier than ever to provide personalization in your marketing.I think with the onset of AI and how quickly it’s transforming and its capabilities, we will see that as the biggest trend. It allows smaller companies to implement predictive and personalized customer journeys, especially in the retail and eCommerce space, and I believe that will be an important trend to jump on in 2025.I think there’s a difference between what’s trending and what needs to trend. What will trend in 2025 will be the shiny object that is AI and all of the cool things that you can do with it… that’s a given. We’ll see more tools rise, and old ones fall. During all of this ebb and flow as marketing technology continues to hockey stick, the ability to connect with humans on a deeper level will be what people will resonate with. What needs to trend is knowing our customers better and using technology to build deeper relationships with customers.Without a doubt, it’s AI. This should come as no surprise. You’ve been living under a rock if you haven’t realized the importance of this, but it’s shocking how many small businesses are ignoring it when it’s going to radically change the face of how we do business.How to start preparing?

You’re actually limiting yourself by being everything for everybody.One of my clients Lauren ran a digital agency offering everything under the sun.Social media, paid ads, web dev, SEO, and she offered it to clients from many different industries.Because of this, her agency stayed stuck at $25,000 a month and she couldn’t break through.On top of that, she and her team worked so much harder than they had to and operations were messy.Every client needed different things, required customization, and nothing was standardized.We sat together to audit all her past clients, and we found that Medical practices were her best clients.They were easy to sell, stayed the longest, and gave her the least amount of headaches and complaints.So, she changed her entire business model to ONLY service this industry.Then, she developed a standardized offer for that industry, rather than customizing everything.One offer, to one target market. Afterwards, she started cold emailing businesses in her niche with her new offer. She 2X’d her revenues and grew to $52,000 in monthly revenue in not even four months time.All from making one simple shift. One decision that can make everything easier, and you can do the same.See, most agency owners and marketers start out with one or t"

And yet digital agencies still suffer from feast or famine months, inconsistent results and timelines on projects, quality control, revisions, and much more. It’s not because they aren’t excellent at what they do. It’s not because there isn’t value in their service. It’s often because they haven’t defined the three most important elements of delivery: the how, the when, and the why. Complicating our operations early on can lead to a ton of failure in implementing them. Business owners overcomplicate their own processes, hesitate to write things down, and then there’s a ton of operational drag in the company. Couple that with split attention and paper-thin resources and you have yourself an agency that spends most of its time putting out fires, reacting to problems with clients, and generally building a culture of “the Founder/Creative Director/Leader will fix it” mentality. Before we chat through how truly simple this can all be, let’s first go back to the beginning. When we start our companies, we’re told to hustle. And hustle hard. We’re coached that it takes a ton of effort to create momentum, close deals, hire people, and manage projects. And that is all true. There is a ton of work that goes into getting a business up and running. The challenge is that we all adopt this habit of burning the candle at both ends and the middle all for the sake of growing the business. And we bring that habit into the next stage of growth when our business needs… you guessed it… exactly the opposite. In Mike Michalowitz’s book, Profit First he opens by insisting the reader understand and accept a fundamental truth: our business is a cash-eating monster. The truth is, our business is also a time-eating monster. And it’s only when we realize that as long as we keep feeding it our time and our resources, it’ll gobble everything up leaving you with nothing in your pocket and a ton of confusion around why you can’t grow. Truth is, financial problems are easy compared to operational problems. Money is everywhere. You can go get a loan or go create more revenue by providing value easily. What’s harder is taking that money and creating systems that produce profitably. Next level is taking that money, creating profit and time freedom. In my bestselling book, The Sabbatical Method, I teach owners how to fundamentally peel back the time they spend in their company, doing everything, and how it can save owners a lot of money, time, and headaches by professionalizing their operations. The tough part about being a digital agency owner is that you likely started your business because you were great at something. Building websites, creating Search Engine Optimization strategies, or running paid media campaigns. And th"

With so much content and ads competing for eyeballs, creating campaigns that stand out is no easy task. That’s where strategies like tagging come in. It helps you categorize and optimize your marketing efforts. It also helps your campaigns cut through the noise and reach the right audience.To help you out, I’ve compiled nine ways brands use a tagging strategy to create an impactful marketing campaign. Let’s get to it. Tagging involves using keywords or labels to categorize and organize content, products, or customer data. You attach tags to specific items or information to make searching, sorting, and analyzing data easier. There are various types of tags, including meta tags, analytics tags, image tags, hashtags, blog tags, and more. So, how do brands use a tagging strategy to make their marketing campaigns stand out?With over 5 billion users, social media provides an easy way to connect with your audience, build relationships, and promote your offerings.Use a tagging strategy to boost social media interactions. Consistently use hashtags that align with current trends and topics. This encourages people to interact with your content and boosts content visibility.You can also use tags to monitor brand mentions of your products or your industry. This allows you to engage with your audience promptly.Consider virtual social media assistants to streamline your tagging strategy. These AI-driven tools can suggest relevant hashtags, track mentions, and automate responses. Implementing them can save time and resources while ensuring consistent engagement across your socials.LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional networking platform, with over 1 billion members across 200 nations. It offers excellent opportunities for individuals and businesses to build and nurture their brands.However, simply creating a professional profile isn’t enough to build a personal brand on LinkedIn. Use various tags to increase your visibility, establish thought leadership, showcase expertise, and attract the right connections. For instance, use skill tags to showcase your expertise and industry tags to attract connections and opportunities within your industry. Use certification tags to help showcase your expertise and credibility to potential employers or clients. Personalization matters—more so in today’s data-driven world. In fact, 65% of consumers expect your brand to adapt to their changing preferences and needs.To meet this expectation, consider using a tagging strategy.Segment your customers based on shared characteristics, such as demographics, interests, purchase history, cart abandonment, and behavior.Here’s a summary of the steps to customer segmentation.With your customer segments ready, use tags to tailor your marketing messages and offerings to specific segments.

Well, you are not alone. Despite 89% of consumers wanting to see more brand videos, there is no one-size-fits-all answer about the ideal video length.However, this should not deter you from creating an effective video strategy. In 2023, people watched an average of 17 videos per day, highlighting the influence of video content in today’s digital landscape.Both short-form and long-form videos offer unique advantages and come with their set of challenges. Join me as I uncover the benefits and limitations of each video format to help you make informed marketing decisions.Short videos typically range from 30 seconds to less than 10 minutes long. They are popular on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube.Short-form videos deliver brief yet engaging messages that quickly capture the viewer’s attention. Here are some popular types of short-form video content.A previously cited report shows that 39% of marketers find short-form videos, ranging from 30-60 seconds long, more successful. The same study reports that 44% of customers prefer watching a short video to learn about a brand’s offerings.So, it is evident that short-form videos have their benefits. Let’s take a closer look at some of them.Short-form videos capture attention quickly, making them ideal for the fast-scrolling nature of social media platforms. Your audience is more likely to watch them in their entirety compared to longer content.Creating short-form videos requires less time and resources compared to longer videos. As a small business owner with a limited budget, using short-form videos can be cost-effective. Short-form videos engage viewers due to their crisp and concise nature. This results in more likes, comments, and shares that boost your content’s visibility and increase brand awareness. Integrating short-form videos into your influencer marketing campaigns can further amplify your reach to new and diverse audiences. Short videos are highly shareable. This makes it more likely for your viewers to share them, increasing their virality. Want to get certified in Content Marketing?Leverage the tools and channels to predictably and profitably drive awareness, leads, sales, and referrals—EVERYTHING you need to know to become a true master of digital marketing.​ Click HereThere are multiple benefits of adding video to your website including increased engagement, improved SEO, and enhanced user experience.While short-form videos offer many advantages in content marketing, they also present some challenges.Due to their brief duration, short-form videos may struggle to convey complex or detailed messages.

The issue of “leads from marketing suck” is a common situation in most organizations. In a HubSpot survey, only 9.1% of salespeople said leads they received from marketing were of very high quality.Why do sales teams hate marketing-generated leads? And how can marketers help their sales peers fall in love with their leads? Let’s dive into the answers to these questions. Then, I’ll give you my secret lead gen kung-fu to ensure your sales team loves their marketing leads. “I’ve hit the lead goal. If sales can’t close them, it’s their problem.”How many times have you heard one of your marketers say something like this? When your teams are heavily siloed, it’s not hard to see how they get to this mindset — after all, if your marketing metrics look strong, they’ve done their part, right?Not necessarily. The job of a marketer is not to drive traffic or even leads. The job of the marketer is to create messaging and offers that lead to revenue. Marketing is not a 100-meter sprint — it’s a relay race. The marketing team runs the first leg and hands the baton to sales to sprint to the finish.via GIPHYTo make leads valuable beyond the vanity metric of watching your MQLs tick up, you need to segment and nurture them. Screen the leads to see if they meet the parameters of your ideal customer profile. If yes, nurture them to find out how close their intent is to a sale. Only then should you pass the leads to sales. Tighter quality control might reduce your overall MQLs. Still, it will ensure only the relevant leads go to sales, which is a win for your team and your organization.This shift will require a mindset shift for your marketing team: instead of living and dying by the sheer number of MQLs, you need to create a collaborative culture between sales and marketing. Reinforce that “strong” marketing metrics that result in poor leads going to sales aren’t really strong at all.  When you foster this culture of collaboration and accountability, it will be easier for the marketing team to receive feedback from sales about lead quality without getting defensive. Remember, the sales team is only holding marketing accountable so the entire organization can achieve the right results. It’s not sales vs marketing — it’s sales and marketing working together to get a great result. Nothing more, nothing less. We’ve identified the problem and where we need to go. So, how you do you get there?What is more valuable to you:Hopefully, you’ll choose the latter. After all, talking to customers and getting a solid testimonial can help your sales tea"

        "fullContent": "Digital Marketing Mastery1-Page Marketing BlueprintAs we march closer to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, CMOs and marketing leaders need to prepare for a significant shift in the digital advertising landscape. Election years have always posed unique challenges for advertisers, but the growing dominance of digital media has made the impact more profound than ever before. In this article, we’ll explore the key factors that will shape the advertising environment in the coming months and provide actionable insights to help you navigate these turbulent waters.The rise of cord-cutting and the shift towards digital media consumption have fundamentally altered the advertising landscape in recent years. As traditional TV viewership declines, political campaigns have had to adapt their strategies to reach voters where they are spending their time: on digital platforms.According to a recent report by eMarketer, the number of cord-cutters in the U.S. is expected to reach 65.1 million by the end of 2023, representing a 6.9% increase from 2022. This trend is projected to continue, with the number of cord-cutters reaching 72.2 million by 2025.Moreover, a survey conducted by Pew Research Center in 2023 found that 62% of U.S. adults do not have a cable or satellite TV subscription, up from 61% in 2022 and 50% in 2019. This data further underscores the accelerating shift away from traditional TV and towards streaming and digital media platforms.As these trends continue, political advertisers will have no choice but to follow their audiences to digital channels. In the 2022 midterm elections, digital ad spending by political campaigns reached $1.2 billion, a 50% increase from the 2018 midterms. With the 2024 presidential election on the horizon, this figure is expected to grow exponentially, as campaigns compete for the attention of an increasingly digital-first electorate.For brands and advertisers, this means that the competition for digital ad space will be fiercer than ever before. As political ad spending continues to migrate to platforms like Meta, YouTube, and connected TV, the cost of advertising will likely surge, making it more challenging for non-political advertisers to reach their target audiences.To navigate this complex and constantly evolving landscape, CMOs and their teams will need to be proactive, data-driven, and willing to experiment with new strategies and channels. By staying ahead of the curve and adapting to the changing media consumption habits of their audiences, brands can position themselves for success in the face of the electoral advertising onslaught.As political advertisers flood the digital market, the cost of advertising is expected to skyrocket. CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) will likely experience a steady climb throughout the year, with significant spikes anticipated in May, as college students come home from school and become more engaged in political conversations, and around major campaign events like presidential"

        "fullContent": "Digital Marketing Mastery1-Page Marketing BlueprintLet’s face it—it does no good to build a funnel and spend zero time optimizing for conversion. That’s a no-brainer, right?But, how many of you are working closely with your head of sales to ensure that the opportunities you help generate actually convert into paying clients? Ultimately, if you want to be seen as a successful marketer, you’re going to have to show that marketing is driving sales.Now, the challenge is that in today’s commoditized world, sales teams often struggle to stand out from the crowd. As a result, closed won rates plummet, and organizations find it challenging to demonstrate to prospects how their total value proposition is the clear winner against all of the other competitors.To make matters worse, many organizations rely on “super hero” sales people or even the founder to close deals. This approach is not sustainable or scalable. You can’t build a successful sales team if you’re constantly relying on a select few individuals to bring in all of the business.The solution to this problem is a sales process that follows a standardized approach while also creating clear differentiation with prospects at the same time. By implementing a systematic sales process, you can scale your sales efforts beyond just the founders and “super heroes.” This will lead to higher closed won rates and higher gross profit margins, as you’ll be able to win at premium prices.The benefits of a systematic sales process are clear. You’ll be able to scale the process beyond founders and “super heroes,” achieve higher closed won rates, and enjoy higher gross profit margins as you’re now able to win at premium prices.When I implemented a systematic sales process in my former agency, I was able to consistently have 60-70% closed won rates, even when I had zero involvement in deals. This is the power of a well-designed sales process. In fact, I standardized this process and called it the Systematic Sales Process™.So, what does a Systematic Sales Process™ look like? Here are the five stages:In this stage, you’ll have a 30-45 minute call with your prospect. The goal of this call is to point your prospect in the right direction—it’s not to “make a sale.” The reason we want to take this approach is that many prospects are likely not a good fit for your firm, so let’s not assume that every first call is an “opportunity.” That’s why we call this call the “Evaluation”—you want to evaluate whether or not you can help your prospect, whether or not they align with your requirements, and whether or not they are ready to move forward. We call this “two-way qualification.”It’s not uncommon to reach the middle-to-end of the call and determine that your prospect, in fact, needs someone or something else other than you!IMPORTANT: You should NOT move anyone beyond this point unless you have full alignment.Do this stage right and you will ensure that your pipeline is real.After you have alignment with your prospect from the "

Or any of the 3 Cs below? Considering any of the above is not bad, in fact, it can be very wise! However, listening quickly becomes devastating if it lends to their running our business or marketing department. It’s time we move from defense to offense, sitting in the driver’s seat rather than allowing any of the 3 Cs to control. It is one thing to learn from and entirely another to be controlled by. In Part 1, we explored how knowing what we want is critical to regaining power.1) Knowing what you want protects the bottom line.2) Knowing what you want protects you from the 3 Cs. 3) Knowing what you want protects you from running on auto-pilot.You can read Part 1 here; in the meantime, let’s dive in! Vertical alignment is a favorite concept of mine, coined over the last two years throughout my personal journey of knowing self. Consider the diagram below.Vertical alignment is the state of internal being centered with who you are at your core. Horizontal alignment is the state of external doing engaged with the world around you.In a state of vertical alignment, your business operates from its core center, predicated on its mission, values, and brand. It is authentic and confident and cuts through the noise because it is entirely unique from every competitor in the market. From this vertical alignment, your business is positioned for horizontal alignment to fulfill the integrity of its intended services, instituted processes, and promised results. A strong brand is not only differentiated in the market by its vertical alignment but delivers consistently and reliably in terms of its products, offerings, and services and also in terms of the customer experience by its horizontal alignment. Let’s examine what knowing who you are looks like in application, as well as some habits to implement with your team to strengthen vertical alignment. The strength of “Who We Are” predicates the ability to maintain vertical alignment when something threatens your stability. When a colleague proposes a tactic that is not aligned with your values. When the customer comes calling with ideas that will knock you off course as bandwidth is limited or the budget is tight. I was on a call with a gal from my Mastermind when I mentioned a retreat I am excited to launch in the coming months. I shared that I was considering its positioning, given its curriculum is rooted in emotional intelligence (EQ) to inform personal brand development. The retreat serves C-Suite, but as EQ is not a common conversation among this audience, I was considering the best positioning. She advised, “Sell them solely on the business aspects, and then sneak attack with the EQ when they’re at the retreat!” At first blush, i"

You can create multiple campaigns in the same account without creating a new account.Social ModuleShareThe practice of marketing is being fundamentally transformed by two events: the rapid acceleration of AI and the phaseout of third-party cookies later this year. Together, these changes will remake the status quo of digital marketing — and redefine how we do our jobs.This is a critical juncture. Like any inflection point, it will bring profound change, including the potential for new growth and opportunity. And leading marketers are seizing the moment.While predicting the future with any certainty is impossible, sharing ideas and perspectives on what’s coming is one way to ensure we’re building a durable future for digital advertising, together. With that in mind, here are some key thoughts from Google leaders about how to chart your course during what is sure to be a remarkable year.Budgets remain tight, and business leaders are ruthlessly prioritizing where to allocate resources. But marketing isn’t always their first choice: only half of CEOs consider it a top growth driver.1 So whether you’re a CMO or a practitioner, you’re facing tremendous pressure to drive business outcomes.This is a challenging moment, to be sure. But it’s also an opportunity to prove and solidify marketing’s role as a profit center. AI is the enabler to help you do it.AI is redefining the value of marketing. With it, we can build stronger connections with our customers, deliver better financial ROI, and make our jobs more interesting by freeing up time to focus on the high-value work that AI cannot do.Where should you begin? My own team’s starting point is AI Essentials, a blueprint for actions you can take today to set your business up for success. And, to keep track of Google AI innovations and industry shifts all in one place, bookmark The AI Handbook for marketers.With Chrome’s third-party cookie deprecation imminent, getting privacy-forward marketing right is top of mind for everyone right now. But rising privacy expectations — and the implications for digital — are not new. So if you haven’t begun, now really is the time to rewrite your privacy playbook.Consumers want relevant experiences from their favorite bra"

So let’s get started!Video marketing (or sometimes “video content marketing”) is a digital strategy that leverages the power of video to attract, engage, and convert an audience into prospects or customers.In plain terms: Your buyers love video. If you create video content for your brand, you can reach more people and convince more of them to buy your product or service.Video can show off product features, tell brand stories, and build relationships with customers way more effectively than virtually any other medium.Do you have a tentpole email nurture that just isn’t converting? Add a video to grab readers’ attention.Do you have a key landing page with a huge bounce rate? Drop in a video to make visitors want to stick around.Do you have an amazing customer success story? Turn it into a video that you can splash across social media.Use cases like these are the reason why 96% of marketers say that video marketing is an important part of their strategy.

But in today’s virtual selling and hybrid work world, the ability to meet a prospect in person is limited. The fix? Video for sales.Video is no longer used just for product demos. With the help of online video platforms, video can be at every stage of the sales cycle, from outreach through to closed-won and handed-off. We’re talking about one-way video messages, known as asynchronous video, which brings back that high-fidelity face-to-face connection and all the mutual accountability that comes with in-person meetings.Asynchronous video is nothing short of a sales secret weapon, and this article will explain how to use it to crush your quota.Video makes people’s ears perk up. Almost all of us feel compelled to click a play button when we see it, which gives you the power to compel prospective buyers to watch your videos, even when they wouldn’t read what you wrote. When it comes to using video for sales, there are really five good reasons you should consider adding it to your sales process.In a sea of text-based emails, a video email can really help you stand out. Not only can it help you increase response rates, but your recipient is also more likely to retain your message vs. text-based email.The move to virtual selling and reduced T&E budgets means sales reps and teams need to get creative when connecting with potential buyers. A video message can help people feel like they know you, making them more emotionally committed and responsive, which is increasingly important when you can’t be there in person.Think of the last time you typed out a message trying to explain a process, workaround, or answer a question and how much easier that would be to get your message across if you had a video to help support it. Video allows you to show, not just tell, and explain more thoroughly.A convenient byproduct of benefits #1 and #3 are the time savings you can achieve by adding video to your sales process. Higher response rates mean more time spent actually selling, and reduced back-and-forth via text communication saves time for everyone involved in the buying process.Using video for selling can help you move that deal to close faster. As a collaboration tool, it’s available on-demand and can be shared with appropriate stakeholders in multi-thread accounts. You can also build a library of content that is used repeatedly from deal to deal to save time that otherwise would’ve taken a live call. Some companies have even cut their deal cycles in half with video.That’s probably why HubSpot has called video prospecting one of the skills every sales development rep needs to master. (And they’re not the only ones who stand to benefit."

Many effective videos are shot with an iPhone or even your webcam. You could step it up and use a DSLR with a 50mm lens. Or you could go whole hog and invest in a hulking, Hollywood-sized camera rig. It all depends on three factors: Budget, skill, and team size.Generally, these things go hand in hand. When your business is small or in startup mode, you don’t have a big team and you often can’t afford a top expert, so you have one producer who wears all the hats. In this case, a smartphone is plenty. As your team and budget grow, maybe you make room for a strategist, a director, and a scriptwriter, in which case better equipment becomes more manageable. Whatever your team can easily get their hands on and will be familiar with is your best option at any given time.Here are three recommended gear sets based on your constraints:Smartphone with a lavalier smartphone microphone, tripod, and ring light. Total cost around $200. Or, a laptop, 1080p webcam, and USB or Bluetooth microphone. The total approximate cost is $300.This type of gear is great for creating sales video messages, videos for a blog, and videos on a budget. This gear is also really portable, so there’s a lot of flexibility in what and where you can shoot!DSLR camera, 50mm lens, wireless microphone, tripod, and lighting kit. Total cost: $1,500 to $1,700.Intermediate gear shoots higher quality footage for flattering customer testimonials, scripted videos, and assets with medium-to-high production value.High-quality video camera, lens adaptor, 50mm lens, 24-105 f4 lens, shotgun microphone, wireless lavalier microphone, tripod, full light kit. Total cost: $9,000 to $10,000.Advanced gear captures the highest quality images possible. It’s for brand videos, TV commercials, and bigger productions.You’ll also want to think about video editing software. This is how you arrange scenes, trim clips, and adjust lighting or sound. You likely already have beginner software on your computer: QuickTime or iMovie.The"

Find strategies for each funnel stage, automation tips, and sales personalization tactics.Inboxes are noisy, often crowded with generic outreach, vague promises, and solutions looking for a problem. Cutting through that noise to find and connect with genuinely interested prospects is a constant challenge. While video cuts through, many organizations still struggle to connect it to core business objectives, such as demand generation and creating a pipeline of qualified new leads.This article breaks down video for lead generation, explaining how to implement a strategic video framework. This guide will also show you how to use Vidyard to turn videos into booked meetings and a measurable pipeline.Video lead generation is the strategic use of video content to capture a potential customer’s interest and contact information, ultimately converting that interest into meetings and opportunities.The goal is to guide a viewer through the buyer’s journey, using video to educate, build trust, and ultimately encourage them to take a specific next step, such as signing up for a webinar, booking a demo, or downloading a technical resource.This process typically involves three key components:Using video is a powerful way to generate leads for several key reasons.Video puts a face to a name, humanizing your brand and fostering a genuine connection that text-based communication often lacks. Testimonial videos featuring real customers or behind-the-scenes content can significantly enhance credibility, as shown in many video marketing success stories. When a prospect sees and hears a person, it creates a personal connection that helps break down the natural skepticism toward sales and marketing messages.Technical products and services are best explained visually. Explainer videos and product demos are highly effective because they can visually break down complex concepts, showcase functionality, and demonstrate value in a way that is easy to digest. It enables prospects to self-qualify and progress through the consideration phase more efficiently.Video is an inherently engaging medium. When used in marketing and sales, it consistently outperforms other content types in driving action. You can track who watched, how long they watched, and what they saw, and then automatically trigger the next best action in the CRM.For instance, including video in outreach emails can increase open rates and lead to a remarkable 26% increase in replies. On landing pages, embedding a video can increase conversion rates, and using video in proposals has been shown to increase close rates by up to 41%.To effectively generate leads, video content must be tailored to the prospect’s stage in the buyer’s journey. A video that works for initial awareness will likely fail to convert a lead who is ready to make a decision.The goal at this stage is to attract a broad audience and raise awareness of a problem or a new type of s"

They wanted to help clients grow — not just balance the books. So they teamed up with IMPACT, the agency behind the They Ask, You Answer framework to set them down the right path. The business believed in video as a powerful tool for bringing the framework to life – educating customers and building trust through authentic connection and storytelling. They also saw an opportunity to scale their video strategy with AI. For Jordan, that meant blending 1:1 video with emerging tools like Vidyard’s AI Avatars to make communication faster, easier, and more personal at every stage of the client journey.We sat down with Jordan to talk about how CSI Accounting & Payroll is balancing authenticity and innovation — and what he’s learned about using avatars to scale real, human connection.💡AI Avatars are now available for free on Vidyard. Sign up here. We first saw avatars showcased at an IMPACT conference a few years ago and thought they were fascinating. We made one for our CEO, Brian Paulson early on, then put it on pause until the tech started improving — and it really has. One of our first big uses was a video on our homepage explaining who’s a good fit for our business.We were already long-time Vidyard users, especially for hosting and video messaging, so integrating avatars into that workflow was a no-brainer. We liked the idea of having everything in one ecosystem — it just made sense.There’s always hesitation around video. People think it’s inconvenient or worry about being on camera. Right now, we’re mostly using AI Avatars for internal videos. They’re a great icebreaker and introduction to the tech. One of our sellers and one of our accountants also have avatars which they use for client communications, like meeting confirmations and recaps.It helps keep our client relationships human and personal. We want our clients to see us more than number crunchers!See more use cases for AI Avatars.The avatar video on our homepage actually outperforms our hero video in terms of retention and views. That’s a big sign people are interested. Once you tell viewers upfront that you’re using an avatar, they stop wondering and just focus on your message.We’re still figuring that out, but in general: If it’s something we’d normally write a long email for, we try to send an avatar video instead. Whereas when we’re trying to convey emotion or strengthen a personal connection, that’s when we’d encourage a team member to get on camera.Yes, having avatars at my fingertips has been a huge help. I can now complete videos that would’ve been pushed aside before. The technology lets me focus on creativity instead of just pr"

No doubt, it can be hard to impress the prospective client looking for a lawyer when your ad is one among seven ads on the SERP, but a lawyer’s high-value offer and call to action certainly stands out more when it’s standing alone on a prospect’s social feed.Other advertisers with high CTRs are in the retail (1.59%), apparel (1.24%), beauty (1.16%), and fitness (1.01%) industries. It’s no surprise that these industries often feature models and high-quality images in their ads, and those ads perform particularly well on highly visual platforms like Facebook and Instagram.You have to be pretty crafty to distract potential job hunters from their social feeds, and employment & job training services can have relatively low CTRs on Facebook (0.47%).

Most commonly, SWOT analyses are used at the organizational level to determine how closely a business is aligned with its growth trajectories and success benchmarks, but they can also be used to ascertain how well a particular project – such as an online advertising campaign – is performing according to initial projections.Whatever you choose to call them, SWOT analyses are often presented as a grid-like matrix with four distinct quadrants – one representing each individual element.

Let’s hit it.A Google Ads account is more than just one account with a bunch of ads. So let’s start with a big-picture overview of its key components:There are different groupings and levels, and certain features and settings are only available at certain levels within your account.At first this may feel confusing, but in the end, it’s designed this way to help you streamline things as much as possible and customize where necessary.So let’s dive into each layer within your account so you can see what I mean.The shell of your Google Ads account is the first layer of PPC management that is often referred to as the “account level.” This is where big-picture portions of your Google Ads get taken care of, like your billing, user permissions, and more.To create a Google Ads account, go to ads.google.com and have an email address handy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a Gmail account. Google Ads Manager accounts (formerly known as My Client Center, or MCC) were designed with agencies in mind as they have multiple clients using PPC. This acts as an umbrella account where you can manage multiple accounts in one place.However, you don’t have to be an agency to have a Manager account. You may be an independent consultant, own multiple businesses or brands, or just have different needs in your PPC plan that require totally separate setups.In short, if you manage more than one account you’ll want to follow the prompts to create a Manager account. If you’re just working in one individual account, though, a Manager account is not needed.🤦‍♀️ Are you making mistakes "

This year’s updates included more automation, additional bidding tools, and even further AI integration.While there are too many changes from the year to list every single one, here are the biggest changes that came to Google Ads in 2025 and what they could mean for you in 2026.Here’s a round-up of the Google Ads changes and updates advertisers saw in 2025 and what they’re going to mean for your strategy next year.At their Google Marketing Live event in May 2025, Google began talking about their Power Pack, now intending to take over for the Power Pair.The Power Pack has three campaign types: Performance Max, Demand Gen, and a new suite of tools called AI Max.Here’s how they’re supposed to work in concert with each other:As far as I can tell, with real-world advertisers running this setup, the jury is still out on whether this approach will really work, but depending on the performance you’re seeing from your campaigns, it could be worth a shot to try in 2026.🛑 How are your Google Ads really performing? Find out with a free, instant audit >> Google Ads Performance GraderWith the announcement of the Power Pack, Google also announced the release of AI Max for Search campaigns. Unlike Performance Max and Demand Gen, this isn’t an entirely new campaign type. Instead, it’s a suite of features you can apply to your Search campaigns. Here are the features you can use:The gist of AI Max for Search campaigns is that they effectively leverage broad match technology with keywordless targeting (think DSA campaigns) to find new users who may convert.They also provide the option to use some of Google’s tools from Performance Max within Search, namely Text Customization and URL Expansion.If you want a more robust rundown of AI Max for Search, you can read this article.Just because a new toy was launched doesn’t mean that the old ones weren’t getting some upgrades this year.Performance Max had a ton of changes, and almost all of them came as more than welcome news to advertisers. We got quite a bit more insight into how the campaigns are performing and controls to improve them. Here’s a quick rundown of what came out:An example of the channel performance report.If you’ve been hesi"

BrightEdge monitored queries from May 2024 to September 2025 and found a jump from 26.6% of queries showing AIOs to 44.4%.I like to run some general queries for different types of searches to help determine how AIOs are showing up.For instance, in January of 2025:As of December 2025, those numbers were:So overall, AI Overviews are impacting a LOT more search results, and if you were targeting a lot of top funnel queries, you might have seen the aggressive rollout of AIOs in 2025 completely change search results (and traffic and leads) for your business in 2025.This led to the initial “great decoupling” of Google Search results in 2025, which essentially referred to the phenomenon for many sites where they would see a massive spike in impressions and a drop in clicks:SourceThis was followed by Google removing &num=100 (more on this later in the article), which led to speculation that maybe there was no real decoupling after all.Nevertheless, many sites experienced a significant decline in traffic to top-funnel terms due to the rise of AIOs.On the other hand, some sites’ search results fell into that “60+%” of search queries (based on the BrightEdge data) that remained unimpacted by AIOs.And, to throw another wrench in the works, late in 2025, Google did start experimenting with more and differently displayed links in AIOs:Seeing more and more links in Google’s AI Overviews! – This one has 7 in-content links directly to the source material!!This is amazing.Big shoutout and thanks to @sundarpichai credit where it is due, this could keep the open web thriving for decades to come.If @sama… pic.twitter.com/lcMh6E0nzg— Joe Youngblood – SEO, Futurology, AI, Marketing (@Yo"

But you may not fully understand what a named account is or how to get started. A named account is a company that your business has identified as a qualified prospect. Each named account should also contain a list of buying committee contacts within that company. This list allows you to create an outreach strategy that is personalized not only to that company, but also to each key decision-maker within the company. Each account on your named account list will be assigned to sales teams and supported by targeted marketing efforts. Assigning each account to one representative ensures that multiple people don’t contact the same company. This makes it easier to begin building a relationship with that company.And since one person is assigned to each account, it’s easier to evaluate what’s working and what isn’t when it is time to look at your account-based program effectiveness. Traditionally, marketers have focused on casting a wide net for lead generation. They nurtured accounts with automated emails and identified target companies only when they raised their hands.ABM takes the traditional marketing funnel and removes the noise of unqualified companies or buyers. Instead, you start by identifying your named accounts, and then engage and build relationships with those companies.There are three reasons why a named account list is a crucial first step to getting started with account-based marketing.Few things can sabotage your marketing efforts faster than duplication. This can be when you send one prospect multiple versions of the same automated email. It can also happen when the same account is targeted by multiple sales or marketing reps. Duplication wastes your marketing budget and ruins your personalization efforts.By assigning a named account to only one sales rep, you’re ensuring that you avoid duplication. One of the unique things about account-based marketing is that it recognizes the different perspectives within the buying committee of each account. You cannot “sell” every person the exact same way.Using named accounts allows you to begin developing a personalized marketing strategy for each company and key-decision maker on your list. Focusing on individual leads is not enough in B2B marketing. Research from Gartner found that there are typically seven to eight people involved in the buying process. So if you’re trying to sell your product or service, you actually need to sell multiple people on the decision, from individual contributors to members of the C-suite By building relationships with multiple individuals, the deal has a higher probability of moving forward. So now that you understand what a named accoun"

It's important to always keep in mind your objective for the email and the perspective of the reader.With outbound emails, it is unlikely that every email will be read in its entirety. In fact, it's unlikely any single email will be read in its entirety, so each one that is sent should have an engaging and complete message.Because of this, you have to aim for a home run on every email by keeping the single concept clear, including enough information in a short, easy-to-read format, and tying it all together with a strong CTA.These are not marketing, lead-warming emails that provide content value. These are cold, outbound sales emails. Each email should have the ability to convince the reader to take the next step outlined in the call to action--the objective. However, you have to remember that you have limited time. People tend to rush through their email inboxes in order to get on with their day, so you only have a few seconds to convince them to take the desired step. That means your email needs to be short — no more than 3–4 \"chunks\" of information in sentences or a short paragraph.The email also needs to stick to one core idea so that it is not confusing. The core idea should be one of the benefits of using your offering or product. Your benefits should be clearly communicated.How to think about the perspective you'll write forHow to determine the objective of your emailHow to build up enough momentum to persuade the reader to take actionHow to use copywriting and persuasive frameworks in your writingTips for email copywriting in generalA step-by-step outbound email process to put all this into practiceGet to know your reader by putting yourself in their shoes. By doing this, you’ll be able to clearly see what they want and what they don't want.During the writing process, and when you proofread your email copy, take the time to put yourself in the reader's shoes and read each email as if you were the person you're trying to connect with.Here are some tips for understanding your reader's perspective.If you only take one thing from this entire guide, it should be that you are writing for someone else. Put yourself in their position. Do they care that your company name is \"XYZ Blah Blah\" and you've been in business for 20 years?

You need to put it on paper, lay out the details, and get the team bought in — that’s what we’ll help you do.The strength of your pitch starts with positioning. Above all else, you’ll want to frame your ABM plan as a way for the organization to achieve its goals. For example, is the company trying to move up-market, expand into new verticals, or generate more SaaS revenue? Connecting your ABM goals to big picture business objectives will help you earn buy-in for these initiatives.You can approach this step in two ways:The focused nature of ABM makes it an efficient revenue driver. Highlight these three benefits to get the main message across:Align sales and marketing teams: With marketing and sales focused on the same target accounts, the company can run coordinated campaigns more likely to perform better.Invest more efficiently: Forget about the spray and pray — ABM arms marketers with a data-driven, prioritized set of accounts to target, enabling them to better allocate their budgets.Close deals faster: The focused pursuit of target accounts can translate to higher win-rates and a shorter sales cycle. According to research from SiriusDecisions, 80 percent of marketers said win-rates were higher among ABM accounts.If you really want to impress, try customizing your approach to specifically address how ABM will influence the company’s big picture business objectives.No matter what those objectives are, each of the three major benefits listed above should contribute positively to the bottom line.The average B2B company relies on traditional demand gen to fill its pipeline and win new business. Moving beyond this model can be scary, but you can begin to put things into perspective by acknowledging how each approach differs in practice. This i"

However, by nurturing every lead more efficiently, you can optimize your funnel and close more business deals. That's why it's crucial to differentiate between marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) and sales-qualified leads (SQLs). In this article, we'll explore the main differences between MQLs vs. SQLs and how understanding this can help you optimize your B2B marketing and sales efforts.Simply put, an MQL is someone who's interested in your products or solutions but not necessarily ready to buy, while an SQL is someone who's interested and intends to buy. The primary difference between MQLs and SQLs is intent, and each type of lead requires different ads, outreach, and other brand messaging.An MQL is someone who shows interest in your brand, products, or solutions but may not be ready to make a purchase decision. They could have visited your site, clicked on a programmatic ad, or downloaded an ebook about a high-level topic in your industry. Their behavior doesn't necessarily indicate direct purchase intent, but it does put them at the top of the marketing funnel and tells you that they might be open to hearing more from your brand. On the other hand, an SQL is someone with buying intent who appears interested in your company's offerings. They have engaged with your brand several times and shown interest in more advanced content like case studies, product comparisons, and pricing charts. An MQL becomes an SQL when they have demonstrated certain signals of intent and are ready to be reached out by your B2B sales team.Understanding the breakdown of MQLs and SQLs is crucial for your marketing and sales teams because it helps you operate more efficiently. MQLs and SQLs are both leads in different stages of their buyer journeys, and knowing how to qualify them helps determine the right messaging each one should receive and when. This qualification process is determined based on lead behavior, score and even type. Lead behavior is all the actions a prospective customer takes while engaging with your brand. Examining lead behavior can tell you a lot about their location in the buyer journey, and you can pull behavior analytics from your account-based platform. You can examine specific actions like what pages the lead has visited and in what order, how much time they've spent on your website, what forms they've filled out and more.Lead scoring is the process of ranking a lead's sales readiness by assigning points based on a list of qualifications and actions they take. Once a contact reaches a certain threshold, they're ready to hand off to sales. In addition to lead behavior, you can assign points based on demographic information, company information, other online behav"

Prepare to be surprised even if you’re familiar with the topic. And if you’re brand new to B2B channel marketing, consider this deep dive your personal field guide to everything you need to know about the subject!B2B (business to business) channel marketing is a complex process that focuses on building relationships with other businesses rather than individual consumers. Key components of successful B2B channel marketing include: Accurately identifying your ideal customer profileDeveloping engaging content tailored to their unique pain points or challenges they face dailyUtilizing a mix of online and offline marketing channels to reach potential customersA marketing channel is an avenue through which brands advertise their products and services. Email newsletters, social media as a whole and as individual platforms, and even referral programs are all considered marketing channels. The benefits of thoughtfully communicating through these channels includes everything from increased engagement to revenue. Whether you realize it or not, you already use several marketing channels in your day to day life. But in the context of B2B marketing, every commonplace marketing channel offers its own unique ecosystem of opportunities that can support a larger goal. Some of the most popular marketing channels include…Email marketing Paid and organic social media advertisingSearch engine optimization (SEO)Attendance and/or sponsorship of trade shows and conferencesNetworking eventsPrint adsDirect mail campaignsTelemarketing including video calls, phone calls, and SMSLong story short: B2B channel marketing involves building relationships with other businesses by identifying the target audience, creating compelling content, and leveraging various marketing channels. While both B2B and B2C (business to consumer) marketing share some similarities in terms of their goals (driving sales, increasing brand awareness, etc.) there are significant differences in how these objectives are achieved. For example, B2B marketers typically focus on long-term relationships with customers who have more complex needs compared to individual consumers targeted by B2C campaigns. Additionally, decision-making processes tend to be lengthier for business buyers due to multiple stakeholders being involved. That means creating more elaborate funnels for single B2B channel marketing strategies or filling out a channel strategy with multiple outlets, all of which are tasks that may"

And with good reason, as a study by Demand Metric found that 97% of ABM practice leaders said that ABM offered a higher ROI than other marketing methods, with 38% calling it “much higher.”At a recent AdRoll ABM lunch and learn, we polled our audience with various ABM questions and found that attendees were at very different stages of implementing their ABM strategies. Some marketers shared campaigns they had already run, such as direct mail posters, while others joined the lunch and learn to find out how to get started.For those marketers who couldn’t attend this lunch and learn event, we thought we would compile the top ABM questions that marketers asked, along with our answers.The answer to this largely depends on the size of company you are targeting. There is definitely still room for inbound marketing in your B2B marketing strategy, especially if you are doing more of a scaled ABM approach, meaning you are working on thousands of accounts rather than hundreds.Imagine a tiered pyramid of accounts. At the top are your tier 1 target accounts, which are the big banner logos that the company needs to close in order to establish itself in the industry. Those target accounts deserve a well-thought out account plan and plenty of sales research time. For these accounts, every email should be personalized, the marketing initiatives should include invites to exclusive events, and the educational content should be catered to their specific use case.Then on the lower tier of P3 accounts, you have your non-named, smaller accounts. An account in this bracket could be a credit union in North America with more than 100 employees and at least 5 locations, for instance.  For these types of target accounts you can build content that is relevant to their industry and use case, but not necessarily customized for them specifically.This ABM question came up twice, which indicates to me that more folks wanted to ask it but may not have felt comfortable speaking up. One marketer, for instance, wanted to know how you pick between sending a box of chocolates or a bag of local coffee.In our marketing department, we built our direct mail touches around our customer success story book and the concept of building better marketing campaigns. We incorporated a blueprint theme across our materials to tie in the “Build Better Campaigns” theme.The process of coming to a decision on the theme and the kits came out of multiple brainstorming meetings where we talked about what information our prospects wanted to know about us and what metrics we could provide for them. But, most importantly, we talked about how we wanted to make them feel upon receiving th"

Retention and upsell strategies will take precedence, with one-to-one engagement styles becoming the go-to for top-tier accounts. And it works — according to our research, 85% of marketers have already reported improved customer retention through their ABM efforts.Retention metrics like customer health scores and engagement rates will drive real-time campaign adjustments.Personalization will go deeper, combining behavioral data with predictive analytics to anticipate client needs before they arise.💡 Pro Tip: Set up automated alerts for at-risk accounts to activate campaigns that prevent churn and foster loyalty.With rising acquisition costs, brands will double down on customer loyalty as a revenue driver. ABM strategies will evolve into customer relationship tools, blending digital intent signals with personal interactions to strengthen partnerships.In-person experiences will pair with customized online engagement, creating a hybrid loyalty approach.Brands prioritizing proactive solutions will see higher upsell opportunities and stronger customer advocacy.💡 Stat to Know: Companies using personalized ABM messaging have seen 50% better customer re-engagement rates.As the future of third-party cookies continues to shift, the race to harness first-party data will heat up. In 2026, 91% of marketers are expected to use intent data for account prioritization and personalized content strategies.To win, brands should:Create owned ecosystems (think resource hubs and gated content) to capture meaningful customer insights.Leverage progressive profiling to continuously refine account knowledge.Use first-party data to power intent-driven campaigns across all stages of the buyer journey.💡 Why It Matters: First-party data is a competitive advantage for account-specific engagement.The future of B2B engagement lies in micro-communities — spaces tailored to niche audiences. These groups will allow brands to create deeper connections and better understand specific buyer personas.Expect growth in private LinkedIn groups, invite-only Slack channels, and curated virtual events.Micro-communities foster peer-to-peer networking and offer valuable insights for refining content strategies.💡 Pro Tip: Focus on curating value-driven conversations that resonate w"

In this article, we'll revisit the basics of the B2B marketing funnel and explore its role in helping businesses understand user interactions with their products or services. By analyzing marketing funnel data, marketers gain valuable insights into customer behavior, allowing them to optimize lead nurturing strategies and improve their products and services. The end result is a win-win: customers receive the most relevant and helpful offers, and businesses can boost their bottom line. We'll cover the stages of the B2B marketing funnel, its benefits, and ways to measure its success. Plus, we'll address common FAQs to help you become a marketing funnel expert. So let's dive in!Also known as a sales funnel or an acquisition funnel, the B2B marketing funnel is a framework that outlines the various stages a business-to-business (B2B) customer goes through before making a purchase. It is a visual representation of the customer journey and the sales process, from initial brand awareness to final purchase and beyond.The B2B marketing funnel is a visual representation of every step that a customer needs to take from discovering a product or service to making a purchase. This makes full-funnel marketing an invaluable tool for businesses as it enables them to understand the customer's journey and devise strategies to engage with potential customers, as well as convert them into paying customers.Over the past few years, the B2B buying journey has changed significantly. Today, B2B buyers do more research on their own, relying less on salespeople and more on the internet. In fact, 89% of B2B researchers use the internet in their research process and they conduct 12 searches before engaging on a specific brand’s site. As a result, the traditional linear B2B marketing funnel has become less effective. Rather than moving through a linear process from awareness to consideration to a decision, buyers now move through a more complex and fluid buying journey.This means that B2B marketers need to be able to engage with buyers at every stage of the buying journey.  This is where account-based marketing (ABM) is key.  ABM is a strategy that  identifies and targets specific accounts, rather than targeting a broad audience. By aligning marketing and sales efforts around specific accounts, ABM can help create a more personalized and effective buying experience for B2B buyers.ABM helps to join the B2B marketing funnel with the sales funnel by aligning marketing and sales efforts around specific accounts.

Creators were amazed. Cultural critics were uneasy. And marketers? They found themselves somewhere in the middle. Both fascinated by the creative possibilities, yet uncertain about what it all means for their brands, budgets, and workflows.While much of the conversation has centered on what AI can create from scratch, there's another side of this story that's just as transformative and, for most marketing teams, a lot more actionable right now.Because AI isn't just changing what video can look like. It's also revolutionizing how marketers produce and use authentic, human-led video.Tools like Sora and Vibes showcase the awe-inspiring potential of AI-generated content. They stretch our imagination and redefine what's possible.But just beyond that frontier, another revolution is unfolding—one that uses AI to enhance the real, human stories brands are already telling.AI is making every step of the real-world video lifecycle faster, smarter, and more efficient. It's helping marketing teams:This is AI working with human creativity, not replacing it. AI is amplifying authenticity—the quality audiences are craving most right now.Generative video models like Sora and Runway also point to a profound shift in how the \"craft\" of video production itself may evolve.Today, one of the biggest bottlenecks in creating professional-grade marketing video isn't shooting footage. Animation, motion graphics, and visual effects make content feel polished, but they are highly skilled, time-consuming disciplines most marketers can't touch without an external agency or design team, creating bottlenecks.AI video tools are beginning to change that. They can synthesize motion graphics, create backgrounds, or even animate static visuals. This dramatically reduces both cost and turnaround time.In other words, the same technology that can generate fully synthetic videos could soon augment and accelerate the production of \"real\" ones, giving marketers access to animation-level quality without the traditional bottlenecks.Herein lies the bridge between the synthetic and the authentic: using generative AI to eliminate friction in professional production so human storytelling can move faster and look better than ever.If AI-generated video showcases AI's imaginative potential, real video demonstrates its connective power. Together, they reveal the full spectrum of what AI can enable.In a landscape where digital experiences can be manufactured in seconds, authenticity becomes one of a brand's most valuable assets. People still want to see and hear from real experts, real customers, and real leaders, and AI can make it exponentially easier for those voices to be seen and heard.While platforms like Sor"

That statistic should stop digital experience leaders in their tracks. By the time people land on your website, they're already conditioned to expect instant answers. They're not in the mood to dig through menus or hunt for links. They want to ask a question and get a clear, intuitive, and trustworthy response.Which raises an uncomfortable truth: Your search bar may be the single most important experience on your site.Generative AI, answer engines, and search overviews are transforming the way people approach information. The rules of digital discovery are no longer fixed. In this new environment, the organizations that focus only on external optimization are missing half the equation.Once users land on your site, the expectations set by AI-powered search tools follow them. If your onsite search cannot keep pace—if it fails to deliver relevant results, understand intent, or provide meaningful guidance—users will bounce back to Google or their LLM search tool. They may not come back.Imagine a procurement manager at a midsize manufacturer who asks an LLM-powered search engine, \"What's the best software for supply chain risk management?\" The AI summary pulls in market comparisons, analyst quotes, and a shortlist of vendors.When that manager clicks through to one of those vendor sites, expectations are already set: They want to type a question into the site's search bar such as \"integrations with SAP,\" \"pricing for mid-market,\" or \"implementation timeline\" and get precise, reliable answers. If the site search fails, the impression is not just of poor navigation but of a company unprepared to meet enterprise needs.For B2B organizations, the stakes are higher because every search interaction reflects brand trust and readiness.That is why onsite search can no longer be treated as a backend utility. It's become a frontline contributor to engagement, conversion, and customer satisfaction.And the most important distinction: Onsite search is the one layer brands fully control.You own the content. You shape the experience. You decide how results are presented, how keywords and questions are interpreted, and how quickly answers are delivered. Unlike external search platforms that shift algorithms without warning, your search experience is your domain.That level of control is rare in this ne"

It's labeled something like \"2024 Webinars\" or \"Event Recordings.\"Inside are dozens of recordings: product demos, customer panels, thought leadership webinars, virtual summit sessions. Hours of content featuring your best experts and customers. And it's all just sitting there.Here's what most B2B marketing teams don't realize: your video library isn't an archive. It's inventory. And right now, you're sitting on unused inventory that could fill your content calendar, feed your sales team, and generate leads for the next six months.According to Wyzowl's State of Video Marketing 2024, some 91% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, but only 39% have a documented strategy for repurposing that content. That gap? That's your opportunity.You don't need to create more content. You need to extract more value from what you already have.And it takes 15 minutes to figure out where that value is hiding.Think about what it takes to produce a single webinar: weeks of planning, speaker coordination, deck building, and promotion. That one hour of video cost you thousands of dollars and hundreds of work hours. Yet most teams use it once, maybe twice.But that webinar—and every other video in your library—contains dozens of reusable assets: product demos for sales, customer testimonials for social proof, expert insights for blog posts, problem-solution moments for ads, and data points for thought leadership.The content is already there. The speakers already said it. You just  need a system to find and package it.Here's how to quickly identify which videos in your library have the most untapped potential.Set a timer. Open your video archive. Let's find your hidden revenue.Pull up whatever analytics you have—Zoom, your video platform, YouTube—wherever your recordings live.Look for these three signals.Videos that score high on all three? Those are your tier-1 assets. Flag them.Any video featuring a customer is immediately more valuable than one without.Why? Because third-party validation sells better than anything you can say about yourself.Scroll through your recordings and flag anything with:Even a 30-second customer quote can become a social post, email signature, or sales asset.Some content has a shelf life. Product updates from two years ago? Probably outdated. Industry predictions for 2023? Not relevant anymore.But some content is evergreen:Flag your evergreen content. These pieces can be repurposed indefinitely and will keep generating value for years.This is where you find the real gold: great moments from videos you've barely promoted.Skim through a few recordings and look for the following.These moments are clip-worthy LinkedIn posts, email hooks, and future content starters.

However, most businesses are still struggling to successfully turn their AI expectations into reality.A mere 25% of CEOs say their AI initiatives have delivered their anticipated ROI.Although larger companies often have the time and resources needed to experiment with this technology, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that are forced to navigate tighter budgets don't have the financial resources to wait for impact. The lack of ROI is extremely costly to their bottom line.SMBs need to see tangible results that can help justify their investments. In short, their AI strategies must take an approach that enables them to drive more near-term results for their business.So how can SMBs turn AI investments into real impact?At a time when business growth is becoming increasingly reliant on  customer experience (CX), with 78% of consumers saying a bad customer experience would cause them to switch from using a business, SMB marketers are in a prime position to help their businesses reap the benefits of AI.Marketers are the driving force behind the initial interactions that leads have with their brand, and in today's CX-centric world, those first impressions are everything. Especially when people are willing to move their business elsewhere when their expectations aren't met.Enhanced customer experiences now play a critical role not just in converting leads into customers for SMBs but also in their overall growth as well. That CX demand offers SMB marketers a unique opportunity to make AI investments that'll drive actual, and immediate, results for their business.Considering the explosion of AI tools available to businesses, finding the right solution can be a major obstacle—in fact, nearly half (48%) of small businesses using AI are struggling to choose the right tools.Because SMB marketers require solutions that can drive actual results while enabling them to deliver enhanced CX interactions, they should be prioritizing investments in voice AI, which is able to process and generate human-like speech.Instead of a generic robotic voice that's limited in responses, voice AI solutions provide customers with human-like interactions with the ability to recognize and adapt responses based on everything from tone to caller needs.Voice AI capabilities take traditional interactions to the next level. Powered with the right voice AI tool, SMB marketers can achieve three strategic objectives.Because of resource restraints, SMBs often have smaller teams tasked with wearing many hats. Therefore, as calls come in, they may well be occupied with other high-priority tasks, resulting in calls that go unanswered.For SMBs, each call is an opportunity, and missed calls result in missed revenue.Voice AI solutions equip SMBs with the ability to ensure every call to their business gets is picked up, even when the business is c"

You may have seen it reflected in decreasing organic traffic to your website.These days, your customers aren't always starting their research with Google. They're now asking questions on ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude and relying on zero-click searches.As for what feeds these AI search results, here's what's really interesting: AI-driven search systems love well-written press releases.That's right; the format that's been around for decades is now the content type AI trusts the most.Let's unpack why and explain how you can use this to your advantage.For years, SEO only involved keywords, backlinks, and meta tags. But now, people are searching differently.When someone types latest cybersecurity solutions for healthcare into Gemini or which manufacturer announced new sustainability goals in 2025 into ChatGPT, these tools don't just look at blogs.AI tools look for factual, structured, and trusted content—the type of information they can confidently summarize and cite.That's where press releases come in.A 2025 Bond Capital report on AI trends notes that generative AI tools are rapidly shifting toward \"retrieval-based generation,\" which means they pull information from verified, structured sources—not random websites.And few formats check these boxes better than a press release.AI models are very smart, albeit picky, readers. They love structure, authority, and clarity.Here's how press releases deliver all three.And according to the 2025 Bond Capital report, tools like Gemini and ChatGPT now use vector-based ranking systems that prioritize content with metadata, timestamps, and verified sources—key elements of a properly formatted press release.Let's look at how this plays out in the real world across some of the biggest B2B sectors.Across every industry, the same rule applies: the clearer, more structured, and better-sourced your announcement, the more likely it is to surface and stay visible in AI-powered discovery.If you want your next announcement to show up in AI results, not just on news sites, start here.As a B2B marketer, you're no longer just writing for people; you're writing for algorithms that serve people.Your next press release could be the answer AI gives to questions like:And when your brand is the answer, you win visibility that lasts far beyond your launch day.This shift doesn't make marketing and public relations less human; it makes them more strategic.The world of discovery has changed, and your press releases can lead the way. When your news is structured, factual, and published through trusted channels, you're giving AI exactly what it's looking for.Because at the end of the day, LLMs don't love press releases because they're traditional; LLMs love press releases because they're trustworthy.And in an age where trust drives visibility, that's a powerful advantage.Enter your ema"

        "fullContent": "Get the free mini-course, expert insights, and strategies delivered to your inbox.Many industries have been slow to adopt AI, but one in particular has professionals especially questioning the ethical ramifications of using AI for their work: writing.While some writers are skeptical about AI—or even flat-out refuse to use it—others, like seasoned freelance writer Jennifer Goforth Gregory, are embracing AI, while creating and maintaining their own personal code of ethics around the technology.“I've always been positive about [AI], and I've always felt that in the end, it's going to make writers more valued than we were before,” Gregory says. “I have never been in the gloom and doom camp with it at all.”Here are three things Gregory believes to be true about AI:With more than 30 years of experience as a B2B technology writer, Gregory has worked with top brands, including Lenovo, Google, Dell and Microsoft, among others, covering AI, cybersecurity, IoT, cloud, digital transformation and storage.Gregory also teaches and mentors freelance writers through books, courses and her nearly 10,000-member strong Facebook group, The Freelance Content Marketing Writer.Gregory’s ultimate stance on using AI as a freelance writer: “This is a good thing, and we need to learn how to use it responsibly and ethically.”Unlike many freelance writers who have approached AI with fear and trepidation—Gregory says a hot topic in her freelancer Facebook group is losing clients to AI—she has always been pro-AI.The writers that are going to survive this massive shift in our industry will adopt what Gregory calls an inventor’s mindset.The concept is simple: Try something new in your business, and see what works. If it works, keep doing more of it.

Then they get a lightbulb moment then they make six more changes till it’s the way that they want it. And then they come up with something that works. But it usually looks totally different than they thought it would.”Gregory recently launched a series on LinkedIn called Tinkering Tuesdays where she encourages folks to try something new in their businesses without fear of failure.“The short version is that the best way to reinvent yourself in the AI era is to give yourself permission to try new things without viewing it as a failure, but part of the process,” she writes.\"It’s time for writers to stop overthinking AI.\"The messy middle we’re currently in is the perfect time to adopt that inventor’s mindset and start tinkering.“This is evolving, and as writers, we need to stay up on what's happening. I feel very strongly that writers will need to understand, use and be aware of the ethics of AI going forward to be successful,” Gregory says. “It's not something we can ignore.”Here’s the primary reason Gregory isn’t w"
